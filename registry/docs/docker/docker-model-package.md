Description

Package a model into a Docker Model OCI artifact

Usage

`docker model package (--gguf <path> | --safetensors-dir <path> | --dduf <path> | --from <model>) [--license <path>...] [--mmproj <path>] [--context-size <tokens>] [--push] MODEL`

## [Description](#description)

Package a model into a Docker Model OCI artifact.

The model source must be one of: --gguf A GGUF file (single file or first shard of a sharded model) --safetensors-dir A directory containing .safetensors and configuration files --dduf A .dduf (Diffusers Unified Format) archive --from An existing packaged model reference

By default, the packaged artifact is loaded into the local Model Runner content store. Use --push to publish the model to a registry instead.

MODEL specifies the target model reference (for example: myorg/llama3:8b). When using --push, MODEL must be a registry-qualified reference.

Packaging behavior:

GGUF --gguf must point to a .gguf file. For sharded models, point to the first shard. All shards must: • reside in the same directory • follow an indexed naming convention (e.g. model-00001-of-00015.gguf) All shards are automatically discovered and packaged together.

Safetensors --safetensors-dir must point to a directory containing .safetensors files and required configuration files (e.g. model config, tokenizer files). All files under the directory (including nested subdirectories) are automatically discovered. Each file is packaged as a separate OCI layer.

DDUF --dduf must point to a .dduf archive file.

Repackaging --from repackages an existing model. You may override selected properties such as --context-size to create a variant of the original model.

Multimodal models Use --mmproj to include a multimodal projector file.
