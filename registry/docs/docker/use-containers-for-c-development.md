## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

Complete [Containerize a C++ application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/cpp/containerize/).

## [Overview](#overview)

In this section, you'll learn how to set up a development environment for your containerized application. This includes:

- Configuring Compose to automatically update your running Compose services as you edit and save your code

## [Get the sample application](#get-the-sample-application)

Clone the sample application to use with this guide. Open a terminal, change directory to a directory that you want to work in, and run the following command to clone the repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/c-plus-plus-docker.git && cd c-plus-plus-docker
```

## [Automatically update services](#automatically-update-services)

Use Compose Watch to automatically update your running Compose services as you edit and save your code. For more details about Compose Watch, see [Use Compose Watch](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/file-watch/).

Open your `compose.yml` file in an IDE or text editor and then add the Compose Watch instructions. The following example shows how to add Compose Watch to your `compose.yml` file.

```

```yaml
services:
  ok-api:
    image: ok-api
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    develop:
      watch:
        - action: rebuild
          path: .
```

Run the following command to run your application with Compose Watch.

```console
$ docker compose watch
```

Now, if you modify your `ok_api.cpp` you will see the changes in real time without re-building the image.

To test it out, open the `ok_api.cpp` file in your favorite text editor and change the message from `{"Status" : "OK"}` to `{"Status" : "Updated"}`. Save the file and refresh your browser at <http://localhost:8080>. You should see the updated message.

Press `ctrl+c` in the terminal to stop your application.

## [Summary](#summary)

In this section, you also learned how to use Compose Watch to automatically rebuild and run your container when you update your code.

## [Next steps](#next-steps)

In the next section, you'll take a look at how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
