This page helps troubleshoot common user provisioning issues including user roles, attributes, and unexpected account behavior with SCIM and Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning.

## [SCIM attribute values are overwritten or ignored](#scim-attribute-values-are-overwritten-or-ignored)

### [Error message](#error-message)

Typically, this scenario does not produce an error message in Docker or your IdP. This issue usually surfaces as incorrect role or team assignment.

### [Causes](#causes)

- JIT provisioning is enabled, and Docker is using values from your IdP's SSO login flow to provision the user, which overrides SCIM-provided attributes.
- SCIM was enabled after the user was already provisioned via JIT, so SCIM updates don't take effect.

### [Affected environments](#affected-environments)

- Docker organizations using SCIM with SSO
- Users provisioned via JIT prior to SCIM setup

### [Steps to replicate](#steps-to-replicate)

1. Enable JIT and SSO for your Docker organization.
2. Sign in to Docker as a user via SSO.
3. Enable SCIM and set role/team attributes for that user.
4. SCIM attempts to update the user's attributes, but the role or team assignment does not reflect changes.

### [Solutions](#solutions)

#### [Disable JIT provisioning (recommended)](#disable-jit-provisioning-recommended)

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/).
2. Select **Admin Console**, then **SSO and SCIM**.
3. Find the relevant SSO connection.
4. Select the **actions menu** and choose **Edit**.
5. Disable **Just-in-Time provisioning**.
6. Save your changes.

With JIT disabled, Docker uses SCIM as the source of truth for user creation and role assignment.

**Keep JIT enabled and match attributes**

If you prefer to keep JIT enabled:

- Make sure your IdP's SSO attribute mappings match the values being sent by SCIM.
- Avoid configuring SCIM to override attributes already set via JIT.

This option requires strict coordination between SSO and SCIM attributes in your IdP configuration.

## [SCIM updates don't apply to existing users](#scim-updates-dont-apply-to-existing-users)

### [Causes](#causes-1)

User accounts were originally created manually or via JIT, and SCIM is not linked to manage them.

### [Solution](#solution)

SCIM only manages users that it provisions. To allow SCIM to manage an existing user:

1. Remove the user manually from the Docker [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin).
2. Trigger provisioning from your IdP.
3. SCIM will re-create the user with correct attributes.

> Warning
>
> Deleting a user removes their resource ownership (e.g., repositories). Transfer ownership before removing the user.
