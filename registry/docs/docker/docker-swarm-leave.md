# docker swarm leave

Copy as Markdown

Open Markdown Ask Docs AI Claude Open in Claude

Description

Leave the swarm

Usage

`docker swarm leave [OPTIONS]`

Swarm This command works with the Swarm orchestrator.

## [Description](#description)

When you run this command on a worker, that worker leaves the swarm.

You can use the `--force` option on a manager to remove it from the swarm. However, this does not reconfigure the swarm to ensure that there are enough managers to maintain a quorum in the swarm. The safe way to remove a manager from a swarm is to demote it to a worker and then direct it to leave the quorum without using `--force`. Only use `--force` in situations where the swarm will no longer be used after the manager leaves, such as in a single-node swarm.

## [Options](#options)

Option

Default

Description

`-f, --force`

Force this node to leave the swarm, ignoring warnings

## [Examples](#examples)

Consider the following swarm, as seen from the manager:

```console
$ docker node ls

ID                           HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
7ln70fl22uw2dvjn2ft53m3q5    worker2   Ready   Active
dkp8vy1dq1kxleu9g4u78tlag    worker1   Ready   Active
dvfxp4zseq4s0rih1selh0d20 *  manager1  Ready   Active        Leader
```

To remove `worker2`, issue the following command from `worker2` itself:

```console
$ docker swarm leave

Node left the default swarm.
```

The node will still appear in the node list, and marked as `down`. It no longer affects swarm operation, but a long list of `down` nodes can clutter the node list. To remove an inactive node from the list, use the [`node rm`](/reference/cli/docker/node/rm/) command.
