# Inspect a service on the swarm

Copy as Markdown

Open Markdown Ask Docs AI Claude Open in Claude

***

When you have [deployed a service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/deploy-service/) to your swarm, you can use the Docker CLI to see details about the service running in the swarm.

1. If you haven't already, open a terminal and ssh into the machine where you run your manager node. For example, the tutorial uses a machine named `manager1`.

2. Run `docker service inspect --pretty <SERVICE-ID>` to display the details about a service in an easily readable format.

   To see the details on the `helloworld` service:

   ```console
   [manager1]$ docker service inspect --pretty helloworld

   ID:		9uk4639qpg7npwf3fn2aasksr
   Name:		helloworld
   Service Mode:	REPLICATED
    Replicas:		1
   Placement:
   UpdateConfig:
    Parallelism:	1
   ContainerSpec:
    Image:		alpine
    Args:	ping docker.com
   Resources:
   Endpoint Mode:  vip
   ```

   > Tip
   >
   > To return the service details in json format, run the same command without the `--pretty` flag.

   ```console
   [manager1]$ docker service inspect helloworld
   [
   {
       "ID": "9uk4639qpg7npwf3fn2aasksr",
       "Version": {
           "Index": 418
       },
       "CreatedAt": "2016-06-16T21:57:11.622222327Z",
       "UpdatedAt": "2016-06-16T21:57:11.622222327Z",
       "Spec": {
           "Name": "helloworld",
           "TaskTemplate": {
               "ContainerSpec": {
                   "Image": "alpine",
                   "Args": [
                       "ping",
                       "docker.com"
                   ]
               },
               "Resources": {
                   "Limits": {},
                   "Reservations": {}
               },
               "RestartPolicy": {
                   "Condition": "any",
                   "MaxAttempts": 0
               },
               "Placement": {}
           },
           "Mode": {
               "Replicated": {
                   "Replicas": 1
               }
           },
           "UpdateConfig": {
               "Parallelism": 1
           },
           "EndpointSpec": {
               "Mode": "vip"
           }
       },
       "Endpoint": {
           "Spec": {}
       }
   }
   ]
   ```

3. Run `docker service ps <SERVICE-ID>` to see which nodes are running the service:

   ```console
   [manager1]$ docker service ps helloworld

   NAME                                    IMAGE   NODE     DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE           ERROR               PORTS
   helloworld.1.8p1vev3fq5zm0mi8g0as41w35  alpine  worker2  Running        Running 3 minutes
   ```

   In this case, the one instance of the `helloworld` service is running on the `worker2` node. You may see the service running on your manager node. By default, manager nodes in a swarm can execute tasks just like worker nodes.

   Swarm also shows you the `DESIRED STATE` and `CURRENT STATE` of the service task so you can see if tasks are running according to the service definition.

4. Run `docker ps` on the node where the task is running to see details about the container for the task.

   > Tip
   >
   > If `helloworld` is running on a node other than your manager node, you must ssh to that node.

   ```console
   [worker2]$ docker ps

   CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
   e609dde94e47        alpine:latest       "ping docker.com"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes                            helloworld.1.8p1vev3fq5zm0mi8g0as41w35
   ```

Next, you'll change the scale for the service running in the swarm.
