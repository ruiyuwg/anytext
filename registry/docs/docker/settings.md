You can configure the following settings in Docker Hub:

- [Default privacy](#default-privacy): Settings for all repositories within each namespace
- [Notifications](#notifications): Personal settings for autobuild notifications

## [Default privacy](#default-privacy)

You can configure the following default privacy settings for all repositories in a namespace:

- [Disable creation of public repos](#disable-creation-of-public-repos): Prevent organization users from creating public repositories (organization namespaces only)
- [Configure default repository privacy](#configure-default-repository-privacy): Set the default repository privacy for new repositories

### [Disable creation of public repos](#disable-creation-of-public-repos)

Subscription: Business

For: Administrators

Organization owners and editors can prevent creating public repositories within organization namespaces. You cannot configure this setting for personal account namespaces.

> Note
>
> Enabling this feature does not affect existing public repositories. Any public repositories that already exist will remain public. To make them private, you must change their visibility in the individual repository settings.

To configure the disable public repositories setting for an organization namespace:

1. Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
2. Select **My Hub**.
3. Select your organization from the top-left account drop-down.
4. Select **Settings** > **Default privacy**.
5. Toggle **Disable public repositories** to your desired setting.
6. Select **Save**.

### [Configure default repository privacy](#configure-default-repository-privacy)

Use the default repository privacy setting to automatically set privacy for repositories created via `docker push` commands when the repository doesn't exist yet. In this case, Docker Hub automatically creates the repository with the default repository privacy for that namespace.

> Note
>
> You cannot configure the default repository privacy setting when **Disable public repositories** is enabled.

To configure the default repository privacy for a namespace:

1. Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

2. Select **My Hub**.

3. Select your organization or account from the top-left account drop-down.

4. Select **Settings** > **Default privacy**.

5. In **Default repository privacy**, select the desired default privacy setting:

   - **Public**: All new repositories appear in Docker Hub search results and can be pulled by everyone.
   - **Private**: All new repositories don't appear in Docker Hub search results and are only accessible to you and collaborators. In addition, if the repository is created in an organization's namespace, then the repository is accessible to those with applicable roles or permissions.

6. Select **Save**.

## [Notifications](#notifications)

You can send notifications to your email for all your repositories using autobuilds.

### [Configure autobuild notifications](#configure-autobuild-notifications)

1. Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

2. Select **My Hub**.

3. Select your personal account from the top-left account drop-down.

4. Select **Settings** > **Notifications**.

5. Select the notifications to receive by email:

   - **Off**: No notifications.
   - **Only failures**: Only notifications about failed builds.
   - **Everything**: Notifications for successful and failed builds.

6. Select **Save**.
