# Use build cache providers

Accelerate local development by caching and reusing builds from a provider.

Build caching is a feature that speeds up `npx expo run:[android|ios]` by caching builds remotely, based on the project [fingerprint](/versions/latest/sdk/fingerprint). When you run `npx expo run:[android|ios]`, it checks if a build with a matching fingerprint exists, then downloads and launches it rather than compiling it again. Otherwise, the project is compiled as usual and then the resulting binary is uploaded to the remote cache for future runs.

## Using EAS as a build provider

To use the EAS Build provider plugin, start by installing the `eas-build-cache-provider` package as a developer dependency:

```sh
npx expo install eas-build-cache-provider --dev
```

Then, update your **app.json** to include the `buildCacheProvider` property and its provider:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "buildCacheProvider": "eas"
    ... 
  }
}
```

You can roll your own cache provider by exporting a plugin that implements the following methods:

```ts
type BuildCacheProviderPlugin<T = any> = {
  /**
   * Try to fetch an existing build. Return its URL or null if missing.
   */
  resolveBuildCache(props: ResolveBuildCacheProps, options: T): Promise<string | null>;

  /**
   * Upload a new build binary. Return its URL or null on failure.
   */
  uploadBuildCache(props: UploadBuildCacheProps, options: T): Promise<string | null>;

  /**
   * (Optional) Customize the fingerprint hash algorithm.
   */
  calculateFingerprintHash?: (
    props: CalculateFingerprintHashProps,
    options: T
  ) => Promise<string | null>;
};

type ResolveBuildCacheProps = {
  projectRoot: string;
  platform: 'android' | 'ios';
  runOptions: RunOptions;
  fingerprintHash: string;
};
type UploadBuildCacheProps = {
  projectRoot: string;
  buildPath: string;
  runOptions: RunOptions;
  fingerprintHash: string;
  platform: 'android' | 'ios';
};
type CalculateFingerprintHashProps = {
  projectRoot: string;
  platform: 'android' | 'ios';
  runOptions: RunOptions;
};
```

A reference implementation using GitHub Releases to cache builds can be found in the [Build Cache Provider Example](https://github.com/expo/examples/tree/master/with-github-remote-build-cache-provider).

## Creating a custom build provider

Start by creating a **provider** directory for writing the provider plugin in TypeScript and add a **provider.plugin.js** file in the project root, which will be the plugin's entry point.

### Create a `provider/tsconfig.json` file

```json
{
  "extends": "expo-module-scripts/tsconfig.plugin",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "build",
    "rootDir": "src"
  },
  "include": ["./src"],
  "exclude": ["**/__mocks__/*", "**/__tests__/*"]
}
```

### Create a `provider/src/index.ts` file for your plugin

```ts
import { type BuildCacheProviderPlugin } from '@expo/config';

const plugin: BuildCacheProviderPlugin = {
  resolveBuildCache: async () => {
    console.log('Searching for remote builds...');
    return null;
  },
  uploadBuildCache: async () => {
    console.log('Uploading build to remote...');
    return null;
  },
};

export default plugin;
```

### Create an `provider.plugin.js` file in the root directory

```js
// This file configures the entry file for your plugin.
module.exports = require('./provider/build');
```

### Build your provider plugin

At the root of your project, run `npm run build provider` to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode.

### Configure your example project to use your plugin by adding the following line to the `example/app.json` file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ... 
    "buildCacheProvider": {
      "plugin": "./provider.plugin.js"
    }
  }
}
```

### Test your provider

When you run the `npx expo run` command inside your **example** directory, you should see your plugin's console statements in the logs.

```sh
cd example
npx expo run:android
npx expo run:ios
```

That's it! You now have a remote build cache provider to speed up your builds.

### Passing custom options

To inject custom options to your plugin you can use the `options` field and it will be forwarded as the second parameter of your custom functions. To do so modify the `buildCacheProvider` field in **example/app.json** as shown below:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ... 
    "buildCacheProvider": {
      "plugin": "./provider.plugin.js",
      "options": {
        "myCustomKey": "XXX-XXX-XXX"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
