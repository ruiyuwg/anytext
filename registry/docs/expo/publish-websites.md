# Publish websites

Learn how to deploy Expo websites for production.

An Expo web app can be served locally for testing the production behavior, and deployed to a hosting service. We recommend deploying to [EAS Hosting](/eas/hosting) for the best feature support. You can also self-host or use a third-party service.

[Deploying instantly with EAS](/eas/hosting/get-started) — EAS Hosting is the best way to deploy your web app with support for custom domains, SSL, and more.

> For SDK 49 and earlier, you may need the [guide for publishing `webpack` builds](/archive/publishing-websites-webpack).

## Output targets

The [`web.output`](/versions/latest/config/app#output) target can be configured in the [app config](/workflow/configuration) to set the export method for the web app:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "web": {
      "output": "server",
      "bundler": "metro"
    }
  }
}
```

Expo Router supports three output targets for web apps.

| Output | Expo Router | API Routes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `single` (default) | ✓ | ✗ | Outputs a Single Page Application (SPA) with a single **index.html** in the output directory and has no statically indexable HTML. |
| `server` | ✓ | ✓ | Creates **client** and **server** directories. Client files are output as separate HTML files. API routes as separate JavaScript files for hosting with a custom Node.js server. |
| `static` | ✓ | ✗ | Outputs separate HTML files for every route in the **app** directory. |

> **Note**: For `static` and `server` output modes, you can configure [global HTTP headers](/router/web/server-headers) that are applied to all route responses via the `expo-router` plugin.

## Create a build

Creating a build of the project is the first step to publishing a web app. Whether you want to serve it locally or deploy to a hosting service, you'll need to export all JavaScript and assets of a project. This is known as a static bundle. It can be exported by running the following command:

Run the universal export command to compile the project for web:

```sh
npx expo export -p web
```

The resulting project files are located in the **dist** directory. Any files inside the **public** directory are also copied to the **dist** directory.

> Some paths such as `/assets` are reserved by Metro. Avoid placing files in **public/assets/** or other reserved paths. See [Reserved paths](/router/reference/reserved-paths) for the complete list.

## Serve locally

Use `npx expo serve` to quickly test locally how your website will be hosted in production. Run the following command to serve the static bundle:

```sh
npx expo serve
```

Open [`http://localhost:8081`](http://localhost:8081) to see your project in action. This is **HTTP only**, so permissions, camera, location, and many other secure features may not work as expected.

## Hosting with EAS

When you're ready to go to production, you can instantly deploy your website with EAS CLI.

## Hosting on third-party services

### Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a mostly-unopinionated platform for deploying web apps. This has the highest compatibility with Expo web apps as it makes few assumptions about the framework.

#### Manual deployment with the Netlify CDN

Install the Netlify CLI by running the following command:

```sh
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

Configure redirects for single-page applications.

> If your app uses [static rendering](/router/web/static-rendering), then you can skip this step.

`expo.web.output: 'single'` generates a single-page application. It means there's only one **dist/index.html** file to which all requests must be redirected. This can be done in Netlify by creating a **./public/\_redirects** file and redirecting all requests to **/index.html**.

```sh
/*    /index.html   200
```

If you modify this file, you must rebuild your project with `npx expo export -p web` to have it safely copied into the **dist** directory.

Deploy the web build directory by running the following command:

```sh
netlify deploy --dir dist
```

You'll see a URL that you can use to view your project online.

#### Continuous delivery

Netlify can also build and deploy when you push to git or open a new pull request:

- [Start a new Netlify project](https://app.netlify.com/signup).
- Pick your Git hosting service and select your repository.
- Click **Build your site**.

### Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) has a single-command deployment flow.

Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

```sh
npm install -g vercel@latest
```

Configure redirects for single-page applications.

Create a **vercel.json** file at the root of your app and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "expo export -p web",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "devCommand": "expo",
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "framework": null,
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/:path*",
      "destination": "/"
    }
  ]
}
```

If your app uses [static rendering](/router/web/static-rendering), then you may want to add additional [dynamic route configuration](/router/web/static-rendering#dynamic-routes).

Deploy the website.

```sh
vercel
```

You'll now see a URL that you can use to view your project online. Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you'll see your deployed app.

### AWS Amplify Console

The [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.amplify.aws) provides a Git-based workflow for continuously deploying and hosting full-stack serverless web apps. Amplify deploys your PWA from a repository instead of from your computer. In this guide, we'll use a GitHub repository. Before starting, [create a new repo on GitHub](https://github.com/new).

Add the [**amplify-explicit.yml**](https://github.com/expo/amplify-demo/blob/master/amplify-explicit.yml) file to the root of your repository. Ensure you have removed the generated **dist** directory from the **.gitignore** file and committed those changes.

Push your local Expo project to a GitHub repository. If you haven't pushed to GitHub yet, follow [GitHub's guide to add an existing project to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).

Login to the [Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home) and select an existing app or create a new app. Grant Amplify permission to read from your GitHub account or the organization that owns your repo.

Add your repo, select the branch, and select **Connecting a monorepo?** to enter the path to your app's **dist** directory and choose **Next**.

The Amplify Console will detect the **amplify.yml** file in your project. Select **Allow AWS Amplify to automatically deploy all files hosted in your project root directory** and choose **Next**.

Review your settings and choose **Save and deploy**. Your app will now be deployed to a `https://branchname.xxxxxx.amplifyapp.com` URL. You can now visit your web app, deploy another branch, or add a unified backend environment across your Expo mobile and web apps.

Follow the steps in the **Learn how to get the most out of Amplify Hosting** drop-down to **Add a custom domain with a free SSL certificate** and more information.

### Firebase hosting

[Firebase Hosting](https://console.firebase.google.com/) is production-grade web content hosting for web projects.

Create a firebase project with the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and install the Firebase CLI by following these [instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

Using the CLI, login to your Firebase account by running the command:

```sh
firebase login
```

Then, initialize your firebase project to host by running the command:

```sh
firebase init
```

The settings will depend on how you built your Expo website:

1. When asked about the public path, make sure to specify the **dist** directory.
2. When prompted **Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)**, only select **Yes** if you used `web.output: "single"` (default). Otherwise, select **No**.

In the existing `scripts` property of **package.json**, add `predeploy` and `deploy` properties. Each has the following values:

```json
"scripts": {
  ... 
  "predeploy": "expo export -p web",
  "deploy-hosting": "npm run predeploy && firebase deploy --only hosting",
}
```

To deploy, run the following command:

```sh
npm run deploy-hosting
```

Open the URL from the console output to check your deployment, for example: `https://project-name.firebaseapp.com`.

In case you want to change the header for hosting add the following config for `hosting` section in **firebase.json**:

```json
"hosting": [
    {
      ... 
      "headers": [
        {
          "source": "/**",
          "headers": [
            {
              "key": "Cache-Control",
              "value": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "source": "**/*.@(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|svg|webp|js|css|eot|otf|ttf|ttc|woff|woff2|font.css)",
          "headers": [
            {
              "key": "Cache-Control",
              "value": "max-age=604800"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
    }
  ]
```

### GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows you to publish a website directly from a GitHub repository.

Start by initializing a new git repository in your project and configuring it to push to a GitHub repository. If you are already syncing your changes with a GitHub repository, skip this step.

Create a repository on the GitHub website. Then, run the following commands in your project's root directory:

```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/expo-gh-pages.git
```

The above commands initialize a new Git repository and configure it to push your source code to the specified GitHub repository.

Install the `gh-pages` package as a development dependency in your project:

```sh
# npm
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# yarn
yarn add -D gh-pages

# pnpm
pnpm add -D gh-pages

# bun
bun add -D gh-pages
```

To deploy the project, configure it to a subdomain with the [`baseUrl`](/versions/latest/config/app#baseurl) property in [app config](/workflow/configuration). Set its value to the string `/repo-name`.

For example, if the GitHub repository is `expo-gh-pages`, the following will be the value of the [experimental `baseUrl` property](/more/expo-cli#hosting-with-sub-paths):

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "experiments": {
      "baseUrl": "/expo-gh-pages"
    }
  }
}
```

Modify the `scripts` in the **package.json** file by adding `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts. Each has its own value:

```json
"scripts": {
 ... 
  "deploy": "gh-pages --nojekyll -d dist",
  "predeploy": "expo export -p web"
}
```

Since Expo uses underscores in generated files, you need to disable Jekyll with the `--nojekyll` flag.

To generate a production build of the web app and deploy it to GitHub Pages, run the following command:

```sh
# npm
npm run deploy

# yarn
yarn run deploy

# pnpm
pnpm run deploy

# bun
bun run deploy
```

This publishes a build of the web app to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository. This branch only contains build artifacts from the **dist** directory, plus the **.nojekyll** file generated by `gh-pages`. It does not include development source code.

Now that the web app is published to the `gh-pages` branch, configure GitHub Pages to serve the app from that branch.

- Navigate to the **Settings** tab of the GitHub repository.
- Scroll down to **Pages** section.
- Ensure the **Source** is set to **Deploy from a branch**.
- Under **Branch** section, select **gh-pages** and the **root** directory.
- Click **Save**.

Once the web app is published and the GitHub Pages configuration is set, a GitHub Action will deploy your website. You can monitor its progress by navigating to your repository's **Actions** tab. Upon completion, your web app will be available at the URL `http://username-on-github.github.io/repo-name`.

For subsequent deployments and updates, run the `deploy` command and the GitHub Action will start automatically to update your web app.
