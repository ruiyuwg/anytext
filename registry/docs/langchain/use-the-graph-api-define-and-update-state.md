## Define and update state

Here we show how to define and update [state](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#state) in LangGraph. We will demonstrate:

1. How to use state to define a graph's [schema](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#schema)
2. How to use [reducers](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#reducers) to control how state updates are processed.

### Define state

[State](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#state) in LangGraph can be a `TypedDict`, `Pydantic` model, or dataclass. Below we will use `TypedDict`. See [Use Pydantic models for graph state](#use-pydantic-models-for-graph-state) for detail on using Pydantic.

By default, graphs will have the same input and output schema, and the state determines that schema. See [Define input and output schemas](#define-input-and-output-schemas) for how to define distinct input and output schemas.

Let's consider a simple example using [messages](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#messagesstate). This represents a versatile formulation of state for many LLM applications. See our [concepts page](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#working-with-messages-in-graph-state) for more detail.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langchain.messages import AnyMessage
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: list[AnyMessage]
    extra_field: int
```

This state tracks a list of [message](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) objects, as well as an extra integer field.

### Update state

Let's build an example graph with a single node. Our [node](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#nodes) is just a Python function that reads our graph's state and makes updates to it. The first argument to this function will always be the state:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langchain.messages import AIMessage

def node(state: State):
    messages = state["messages"]
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": messages + [new_message], "extra_field": 10}
```

This node simply appends a message to our message list, and populates an extra field.

Nodes should return updates to the state directly, instead of mutating the state.

Let's next define a simple graph containing this node. We use [`StateGraph`](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#stategraph) to define a graph that operates on this state. We then use [`add_node`](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#nodes) populate our graph.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(node)
builder.set_entry_point("node")
graph = builder.compile()
```

LangGraph provides built-in utilities for visualizing your graph. Let's inspect our graph. See [Visualize your graph](#visualize-your-graph) for detail on visualization.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```

In this case, our graph just executes a single node. Let's proceed with a simple invocation:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi")]})
result
```

```
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='Hi'), AIMessage(content='Hello!')], 'extra_field': 10}
```

Note that:

- We kicked off invocation by updating a single key of the state.
- We receive the entire state in the invocation result.

For convenience, we frequently inspect the content of [message objects](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) via pretty-print:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()
```

```
================================ Human Message ================================

Hi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello!
```

### Process state updates with reducers

Each key in the state can have its own independent [reducer](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#reducers) function, which controls how updates from nodes are applied. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to the key should override it.

For `TypedDict` state schemas, we can define reducers by annotating the corresponding field of the state with a reducer function.

In the earlier example, our node updated the `"messages"` key in the state by appending a message to it. Below, we add a reducer to this key, such that updates are automatically appended:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from typing_extensions import Annotated

def add(left, right):
    """Can also import `add` from the `operator` built-in."""
    return left + right

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add]  # [!code highlight]
    extra_field: int
```

Now our node can be simplified:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
def node(state: State):
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": [new_message], "extra_field": 10}  # [!code highlight]
```

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import START

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).add_edge(START, "node").compile()

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi")]})

for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()
```

```
================================ Human Message ================================

Hi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello!
```

#### MessagesState

In practice, there are additional considerations for updating lists of messages:

- We may wish to update an existing message in the state.
- We may want to accept short-hands for [message formats](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#using-messages-in-your-graph), such as [OpenAI format](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/#openai-format).

LangGraph includes a built-in reducer [`add_messages`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graph/message/add_messages) that handles these considerations:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]  # [!code highlight]
    extra_field: int

def node(state: State):
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": [new_message], "extra_field": 10}

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).set_entry_point("node").compile()
```

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}  # [!code highlight]

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [input_message]})

for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()
```

```
================================ Human Message ================================

Hi
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello!
```

This is a versatile representation of state for applications involving [chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/). LangGraph includes a prebuilt `MessagesState` for convenience, so that we can have:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

class State(MessagesState):
    extra_field: int
```

### Bypass reducers with `Overwrite`

In some cases, you may want to bypass a reducer and directly overwrite a state value. LangGraph provides the [`Overwrite`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/) type for this purpose. When a node returns a value wrapped with `Overwrite`, the reducer is bypassed and the channel is set directly to that value.

This is useful when you want to reset or replace accumulated state rather than merge it with existing values.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.types import Overwrite
from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict
import operator

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def add_message(state: State):
    return {"messages": ["first message"]}

def replace_messages(state: State):
    # Bypass the reducer and replace the entire messages list
    return {"messages": Overwrite(["replacement message"])}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("add_message", add_message)
builder.add_node("replace_messages", replace_messages)
builder.add_edge(START, "add_message")
builder.add_edge("add_message", "replace_messages")
builder.add_edge("replace_messages", END)

graph = builder.compile()

result = graph.invoke({"messages": ["initial"]})
print(result["messages"])
```

```
['replacement message']
```

You can also use JSON format with the special key `"__overwrite__"`:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
def replace_messages(state: State):
    return {"messages": {"__overwrite__": ["replacement message"]}}
```

When nodes execute in parallel, only one node can use `Overwrite` on the same state key in a given super-step. If multiple nodes attempt to overwrite the same key in the same super-step, an `InvalidUpdateError` will be raised.

### Define input and output schemas

By default, `StateGraph` operates with a single schema, and all nodes are expected to communicate using that schema. However, it's also possible to define distinct input and output schemas for a graph.

When distinct schemas are specified, an internal schema will still be used for communication between nodes. The input schema ensures that the provided input matches the expected structure, while the output schema filters the internal data to return only the relevant information according to the defined output schema.

Below, we'll see how to define distinct input and output schema.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

# Define the schema for the input
class InputState(TypedDict):
    question: str

# Define the schema for the output
class OutputState(TypedDict):
    answer: str

# Define the overall schema, combining both input and output
class OverallState(InputState, OutputState):
    pass

# Define the node that processes the input and generates an answer
def answer_node(state: InputState):
    # Example answer and an extra key
    return {"answer": "bye", "question": state["question"]}

# Build the graph with input and output schemas specified
builder = StateGraph(OverallState, input_schema=InputState, output_schema=OutputState)
builder.add_node(answer_node)  # Add the answer node
builder.add_edge(START, "answer_node")  # Define the starting edge
builder.add_edge("answer_node", END)  # Define the ending edge
graph = builder.compile()  # Compile the graph

# Invoke the graph with an input and print the result
print(graph.invoke({"question": "hi"}))
```

```
{'answer': 'bye'}
```

Notice that the output of invoke only includes the output schema.

### Pass private state between nodes

In some cases, you may want nodes to exchange information that is crucial for intermediate logic but doesn't need to be part of the main schema of the graph. This private data is not relevant to the overall input/output of the graph and should only be shared between certain nodes.

Below, we'll create an example sequential graph consisting of three nodes (node\_1, node\_2 and node\_3), where private data is passed between the first two steps (node\_1 and node\_2), while the third step (node\_3) only has access to the public overall state.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)
class OverallState(TypedDict):
    a: str

# Output from node_1 contains private data that is not part of the overall state
class Node1Output(TypedDict):
    private_data: str

# The private data is only shared between node_1 and node_2
def node_1(state: OverallState) -> Node1Output:
    output = {"private_data": "set by node_1"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_1`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output

# Node 2 input only requests the private data available after node_1
class Node2Input(TypedDict):
    private_data: str

def node_2(state: Node2Input) -> OverallState:
    output = {"a": "set by node_2"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_2`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output

# Node 3 only has access to the overall state (no access to private data from node_1)
def node_3(state: OverallState) -> OverallState:
    output = {"a": "set by node_3"}
    print(f"Entered node `node_3`:\n\tInput: {state}.\n\tReturned: {output}")
    return output

# Connect nodes in a sequence
# node_2 accepts private data from node_1, whereas
# node_3 does not see the private data.
builder = StateGraph(OverallState).add_sequence([node_1, node_2, node_3])
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
graph = builder.compile()

# Invoke the graph with the initial state
response = graph.invoke(
    {
        "a": "set at start",
    }
)

print()
print(f"Output of graph invocation: {response}")
```

```
Entered node `node_1`:
    Input: {'a': 'set at start'}.
    Returned: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}
Entered node `node_2`:
    Input: {'private_data': 'set by node_1'}.
    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_2'}
Entered node `node_3`:
    Input: {'a': 'set by node_2'}.
    Returned: {'a': 'set by node_3'}

Output of graph invocation: {'a': 'set by node_3'}
```

### Use pydantic models for graph state

A [StateGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs.md#langgraph.graph.StateGraph) accepts a [`state_schema`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.AgentMiddleware.state_schema) argument on initialization that specifies the "shape" of the state that the nodes in the graph can access and update.

In our examples, we typically use a python-native `TypedDict` or [`dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) for `state_schema`, but [`state_schema`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.AgentMiddleware.state_schema) can be any [type](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#type-objects).

Here, we'll see how a [Pydantic BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/) can be used for [`state_schema`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/middleware/#langchain.agents.middleware.AgentMiddleware.state_schema) to add run-time validation on **inputs**.

**Known Limitations**

- Currently, the output of the graph will **NOT** be an instance of a pydantic model.
- Run-time validation only occurs on inputs to the first node in the graph, not on subsequent nodes or outputs.
- The validation error trace from pydantic does not show which node the error arises in.
- Pydantic's recursive validation can be slow. For performance-sensitive applications, you may want to consider using a `dataclass` instead.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from pydantic import BaseModel

# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)
class OverallState(BaseModel):
    a: str

def node(state: OverallState):
    return {"a": "goodbye"}

# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(node)  # node_1 is the first node
builder.add_edge(START, "node")  # Start the graph with node_1
builder.add_edge("node", END)  # End the graph after node_1
graph = builder.compile()

# Test the graph with a valid input
graph.invoke({"a": "hello"})
```

Invoke the graph with an **invalid** input

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
try:
    graph.invoke({"a": 123})  # Should be a string
except Exception as e:
    print("An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.")
    print(e)
```

```
An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.
1 validation error for OverallState
a
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]
    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.9/v/string_type
```

See below for additional features of Pydantic model state:

When using Pydantic models as state schemas, it's important to understand how serialization works, especially when:

- Passing Pydantic objects as inputs
- Receiving outputs from the graph
- Working with nested Pydantic models

Let's see these behaviors in action.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from pydantic import BaseModel

class NestedModel(BaseModel):
    value: str

class ComplexState(BaseModel):
    text: str
    count: int
    nested: NestedModel

def process_node(state: ComplexState):
    # Node receives a validated Pydantic object
    print(f"Input state type: {type(state)}")
    print(f"Nested type: {type(state.nested)}")
    # Return a dictionary update
    return {"text": state.text + " processed", "count": state.count + 1}

# Build the graph
builder = StateGraph(ComplexState)
builder.add_node("process", process_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "process")
builder.add_edge("process", END)
graph = builder.compile()

# Create a Pydantic instance for input
input_state = ComplexState(text="hello", count=0, nested=NestedModel(value="test"))
print(f"Input object type: {type(input_state)}")

# Invoke graph with a Pydantic instance
result = graph.invoke(input_state)
print(f"Output type: {type(result)}")
print(f"Output content: {result}")

# Convert back to Pydantic model if needed
output_model = ComplexState(**result)
print(f"Converted back to Pydantic: {type(output_model)}")
```

Pydantic performs runtime type coercion for certain data types. This can be helpful but also lead to unexpected behavior if you're not aware of it.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CoercionExample(BaseModel):
    # Pydantic will coerce string numbers to integers
    number: int
    # Pydantic will parse string booleans to bool
    flag: bool

def inspect_node(state: CoercionExample):
    print(f"number: {state.number} (type: {type(state.number)})")
    print(f"flag: {state.flag} (type: {type(state.flag)})")
    return {}

builder = StateGraph(CoercionExample)
builder.add_node("inspect", inspect_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "inspect")
builder.add_edge("inspect", END)
graph = builder.compile()

# Demonstrate coercion with string inputs that will be converted
result = graph.invoke({"number": "42", "flag": "true"})

# This would fail with a validation error
try:
    graph.invoke({"number": "not-a-number", "flag": "true"})
except Exception as e:
    print(f"\nExpected validation error: {e}")
```

When working with LangChain message types in your state schema, there are important considerations for serialization. You should use `AnyMessage` (rather than `BaseMessage`) for proper serialization/deserialization when using message objects over the wire.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, AnyMessage
from typing import List

class ChatState(BaseModel):
    messages: List[AnyMessage]
    context: str

def add_message(state: ChatState):
    return {"messages": state.messages + [AIMessage(content="Hello there!")]}

builder = StateGraph(ChatState)
builder.add_node("add_message", add_message)
builder.add_edge(START, "add_message")
builder.add_edge("add_message", END)
graph = builder.compile()

# Create input with a message
initial_state = ChatState(
    messages=[HumanMessage(content="Hi")], context="Customer support chat"
)

result = graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(f"Output: {result}")

# Convert back to Pydantic model to see message types
output_model = ChatState(**result)
for i, msg in enumerate(output_model.messages):
    print(f"Message {i}: {type(msg).__name__} - {msg.content}")
```
