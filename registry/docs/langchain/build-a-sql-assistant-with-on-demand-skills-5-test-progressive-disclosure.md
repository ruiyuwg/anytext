## 5. Test progressive disclosure

Test the agent with a question that requires skill-specific knowledge:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import uuid

# Configuration for this conversation thread
thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}

# Ask for a SQL query
result = agent.invoke(  # [!code highlight]
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": (
                    "Write a SQL query to find all customers "
                    "who made orders over $1000 in the last month"
                ),
            }
        ]
    },
    config
)

# Print the conversation
for message in result["messages"]:
    if hasattr(message, 'pretty_print'):
        message.pretty_print()
    else:
        print(f"{message.type}: {message.content}")
```

Expected output:

```

# Sales Analytics Schema

## Tables

### customers
- customer_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- name
- email
- signup_date
- status (active/inactive)
- customer_tier (bronze/silver/gold/platinum)

### orders
- order_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- customer_id (FOREIGN KEY -> customers)
- order_date
- status (pending/completed/cancelled/refunded)
- total_amount
- sales_region (north/south/east/west)

[... rest of schema ...]

## Business Logic

**High-value orders**: Orders with `total_amount > 1000`
**Revenue calculation**: Only count orders with `status = 'completed'`

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Here's a SQL query to find all customers who made orders over $1000 in the last month:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    c.email,
    c.customer_tier
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.total_amount > 1000
  AND o.status = 'completed'
  AND o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month'
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
\`\`\`

This query:
- Joins customers with their orders
- Filters for high-value orders (>$1000) using the total_amount field
- Only includes completed orders (as per the business logic)
- Restricts to orders from the last month
- Returns distinct customers to avoid duplicates if they made multiple qualifying orders
```

The agent saw the lightweight skill description in its system prompt, recognized the question required sales database knowledge, called `load_skill("sales_analytics")` to get the full schema and business logic, and then used that information to write a correct query following the database conventions.
