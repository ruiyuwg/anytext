# Custom instrumentation

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/annotate-code

LangSmith integrations handle tracing automatically. Custom instrumentation lets you define exactly which functions are traced, control what inputs and outputs are logged, and structure your trace hierarchy without rewriting your application logic.

If you are using LangChain (either Python or JS/TS), go directly to the [LangChain-specific instructions](/langsmith/trace-with-langchain).

## Prerequisites

Before tracing, set the following environment variables:

- `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true`: enables tracing. Set this to toggle tracing on and off without changing your code.
- `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`: your [LangSmith API key](/langsmith/create-account-api-key).

  To disable tracing, remove the `LANGSMITH_TRACING` environment variable. This does not affect `RunTree` objects or direct API usage, which are low-level and not controlled by the tracing toggle.

  By default, traces are logged to a project named `default`. To log to a different project, see [Log traces to a specific project](/langsmith/log-traces-to-project).

## Use `@traceable` / `traceable`

The recommended approach is the [`@traceable`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langsmith/run_helpers/traceable) decorator (Python) or [`traceable`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript/langsmith/traceable) wrapper (TypeScript). Apply it to any function to make it a traced run, and LangSmith handles context propagation across nested calls automatically.

The following example traces a simple pipeline: `run_pipeline` calls `format_prompt` to build the messages, `invoke_llm` to call the model, and `parse_output` to extract the result.

Each function is individually traced, and because they're called from within `run_pipeline` (also traced), LangSmith automatically nests them as child runs. `invoke_llm` uses `run_type="llm"` to mark it as an LLM call so LangSmith can render token counts and latency correctly:

```python Python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langsmith import traceable
from openai import Client

openai = Client()

@traceable
def format_prompt(subject):
  return [
      {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "You are a helpful assistant.",
      },
      {
          "role": "user",
          "content": f"What's a good name for a store that sells {subject}?"
      }
  ]

@traceable(run_type="llm")
def invoke_llm(messages):
  return openai.chat.completions.create(
      messages=messages, model="gpt-4.1-mini", temperature=0
  )

@traceable
def parse_output(response):
  return response.choices[0].message.content

@traceable
def run_pipeline():
  messages = format_prompt("colorful socks")
  response = invoke_llm(messages)
  return parse_output(response)

run_pipeline()
```

```typescript TypeScript theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { traceable } from "langsmith/traceable";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const formatPrompt = traceable((subject: string) => {
  return [
    {
      role: "system" as const,
      content: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    },
    {
      role: "user" as const,
      content: `What's a good name for a store that sells ${subject}?`,
    },
  ];
},{ name: "formatPrompt" });

const invokeLLM = traceable(
  async ({ messages }: { messages: { role: string; content: string }[] }) => {
      return openai.chat.completions.create({
          model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
          messages: messages,
          temperature: 0,
      });
  },
  { run_type: "llm", name: "invokeLLM" }
);

const parseOutput = traceable(
  (response: any) => {
      return response.choices[0].message.content;
  },
  { name: "parseOutput" }
);

const runPipeline = traceable(
  async () => {
      const messages = await formatPrompt("colorful socks");
      const response = await invokeLLM({ messages });
      return parseOutput(response);
  },
  { name: "runPipeline" }
);

await runPipeline();
```

In LangSmith, you'll see a `run_pipeline` trace with `format_prompt`, `invoke_llm`, and `parse_output` as nested child runs.

When you wrap a sync function with `traceable` (e.g., `formatPrompt` in the previous example), use the `await` keyword when calling it to ensure the trace is logged correctly.

## Use the `trace` context manager (Python only)

In Python, you can use the `trace` context manager to log traces to LangSmith. This is useful in situations where:

1. You want to log traces for a specific block of code.
2. You want control over the inputs, outputs, and other attributes of the trace.
3. It is not feasible to use a decorator or wrapper.
4. Any or all of the above.

The context manager integrates seamlessly with the `traceable` decorator and `wrap_openai` wrapper, so you can use them together in the same application.

The following example shows all three used together. `wrap_openai` wraps the OpenAI client so its calls are traced automatically. `my_tool` uses `@traceable` with `run_type="tool"` and a custom `name` to appear correctly in the trace. `chat_pipeline` itself is not decorated—instead, `ls.trace` wraps the call, letting you pass the project name and inputs explicitly and set outputs manually via `rt.end()`:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import openai
import langsmith as ls
from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai

client = wrap_openai(openai.Client())

@ls.traceable(run_type="tool", name="Retrieve Context")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
    return "During this morning's meeting, we solved all world conflict."

def chat_pipeline(question: str):
    context = my_tool(question)
    messages = [
        { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the user's request only based on the given context." },
        { "role": "user", "content": f"Question: {question}\nContext: {context}"}
    ]
    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1-mini", messages=messages
    )
    return chat_completion.choices[0].message.content

app_inputs = {"input": "Can you summarize this morning's meetings?"}

with ls.trace("Chat Pipeline", "chain", project_name="my_test", inputs=app_inputs) as rt:
    output = chat_pipeline("Can you summarize this morning's meetings?")
    rt.end(outputs={"output": output})
```

## Use the `RunTree` API

Another, more explicit way to log traces to LangSmith is via the `RunTree` API. This API allows you more control over your tracing - you can manually create runs and children runs to assemble your trace. You still need to set your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, but `LANGSMITH_TRACING` is not necessary for this method.

This method is not recommended, as it's easier to make mistakes in propagating trace context.

```python Python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import openai
from langsmith.run_trees import RunTree

# This can be a user input to your app
question = "Can you summarize this morning's meetings?"

# Create a top-level run
pipeline = RunTree(
  name="Chat Pipeline",
  run_type="chain",
  inputs={"question": question}
)
pipeline.post()

# This can be retrieved in a retrieval step
context = "During this morning's meeting, we solved all world conflict."
messages = [
  { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the user's request only based on the given context." },
  { "role": "user", "content": f"Question: {question}\nContext: {context}"}
]

# Create a child run
child_llm_run = pipeline.create_child(
  name="OpenAI Call",
  run_type="llm",
  inputs={"messages": messages},
)
child_llm_run.post()

# Generate a completion
client = openai.Client()
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4.1-mini", messages=messages
)

# End the runs and log them
child_llm_run.end(outputs=chat_completion)
child_llm_run.patch()
pipeline.end(outputs={"answer": chat_completion.choices[0].message.content})
pipeline.patch()
```

```typescript TypeScript theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { RunTree } from "langsmith";

// This can be a user input to your app
const question = "Can you summarize this morning's meetings?";

const pipeline = new RunTree({
  name: "Chat Pipeline",
  run_type: "chain",
  inputs: { question }
});
await pipeline.postRun();

// This can be retrieved in a retrieval step
const context = "During this morning's meeting, we solved all world conflict.";
const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the user's request only based on the given context." },
  { role: "user", content: `Question: ${question}Context: ${context}` }
];

// Create a child run
const childRun = await pipeline.createChild({
  name: "OpenAI Call",
  run_type: "llm",
  inputs: { messages },
});
await childRun.postRun();

// Generate a completion
const client = new OpenAI();
const chatCompletion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4.1-mini",
  messages: messages,
});

// End the runs and log them
childRun.end(chatCompletion);
await childRun.patchRun();
pipeline.end({ outputs: { answer: chatCompletion.choices[0].message.content } });
await pipeline.patchRun();
```

## Example usage

You can extend the utilities explained in the previous section to trace any code. The following code shows some example extensions.

Trace any public method in a class:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from typing import Any, Callable, Type, TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")

def traceable_cls(cls: Type[T]) -> Type[T]:
    """Instrument all public methods in a class."""
    def wrap_method(name: str, method: Any) -> Any:
        if callable(method) and not name.startswith("__"):
            return traceable(name=f"{cls.__name__}.{name}")(method)
        return method

    # Handle __dict__ case
    for name in dir(cls):
        if not name.startswith("_"):
            try:
                method = getattr(cls, name)
                setattr(cls, name, wrap_method(name, method))
            except AttributeError:
                # Skip attributes that can't be set (e.g., some descriptors)
                pass

    # Handle __slots__ case
    if hasattr(cls, "__slots__"):
        for slot in cls.__slots__:  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
            if not slot.startswith("__"):
                try:
                    method = getattr(cls, slot)
                    setattr(cls, slot, wrap_method(slot, method))
                except AttributeError:
                    # Skip slots that don't have a value yet
                    pass

    return cls

@traceable_cls
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, some_val: int):
        self.some_val = some_val

    def combine(self, other_val: int):
        return self.some_val + other_val

# See trace: https://smith.langchain.com/public/882f9ecf-5057-426a-ae98-0edf84fdcaf9/r
MyClass(13).combine(29)
```

## Ensure all traces are submitted before exiting

LangSmith performs tracing in a background thread to avoid obstructing your production application. This means that your process may end before all traces are successfully posted to LangSmith. Here are some options for ensuring all traces are submitted before exiting your application.

### Use the LangSmith SDK

If you are using the LangSmith SDK standalone, you can use the `flush` method before exit:

```python Python theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langsmith import Client

client = Client()

@traceable(client=client)
async def my_traced_func():
  # Your code here...
  pass

try:
  await my_traced_func()
finally:
  await client.flush()
```

```typescript TypeScript theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
import { Client } from "langsmith";

const langsmithClient = new Client({});

const myTracedFunc = traceable(async () => {
  // Your code here...
},{ client: langsmithClient });

try {
  await myTracedFunc();
} finally {
  await langsmithClient.flush();
}
```

### Use LangChain

If you are using LangChain, please refer to our [LangChain tracing guide](/langsmith/trace-with-langchain#ensure-all-traces-are-submitted-before-exiting).

# Annotate traces and runs inline

Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/annotate-traces-inline

LangSmith allows you to manually annotate traces with feedback within the application. This can be useful for adding context to a trace, such as a user's comment or a note about a specific issue.
You can annotate a trace either inline or by sending the trace to an annotation queue, which allows you to closely inspect and log feedbacks to runs one at a time.
Feedback tags are associated with your [workspace](/langsmith/administration-overview#workspaces).

**You can attach user feedback to ANY intermediate run (span) of the trace, not just the root span.**

This is useful for critiquing specific parts of the LLM application, such as the retrieval step or generation step of the RAG pipeline.

To annotate a trace inline, click on the `Annotate` in the upper right corner of trace view for any particular run that is part of the trace.

This will open up a pane that allows you to choose from feedback tags associated with your workspace and add a score for particular tags. You can also add a standalone comment. Follow [Set up feedback criteria](/langsmith/set-up-feedback-criteria) to set up feedback tags for your workspace.
You can also set up new feedback criteria from within the pane itself.

You can use the labeled keyboard shortcuts to streamline the annotation process.
