# devIndicators

`devIndicators` allows you to configure the on-screen indicator that gives context about the current route you're viewing during development.

```ts filename="Types"
  devIndicators: false | {
    position?: 'bottom-right'
    | 'bottom-left'
    | 'top-right'
    | 'top-left', // defaults to 'bottom-left',
  },
```

Setting `devIndicators` to `false` will hide the indicator, however Next.js will continue to surface any build or runtime errors that were encountered.

## Troubleshooting

### Indicator not marking a route as static

If you expect a route to be static and the indicator has marked it as dynamic, it's likely the route has opted out of static rendering.

You can confirm if a route is [static](/docs/app/guides/caching#static-rendering) or [dynamic](/docs/app/guides/caching#dynamic-rendering) by building your application using `next build --debug`, and checking the output in your terminal. Static (or prerendered) routes will display a `○` symbol, whereas dynamic routes will display a `ƒ` symbol. For example:

```bash filename="Build Output"
Route (app)
┌ ○ /_not-found
└ ƒ /products/[id]

○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

There are two reasons a route might opt out of static rendering:

- The presence of [Dynamic APIs](/docs/app/guides/caching#dynamic-rendering) which rely on runtime information.
- An [uncached data request](/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data), like a call to an ORM or database driver.

Check your route for any of these conditions, and if you are not able to statically render the route, then consider using [`loading.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) or [\`\`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) to leverage [streaming](/docs/app/getting-started/linking-and-navigating#streaming).

# distDir

You can specify a name to use for a custom build directory to use instead of `.next`.

Open `next.config.js` and add the `distDir` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  distDir: 'build',
}
```

Now if you run `next build` Next.js will use `build` instead of the default `.next` folder.

> `distDir` **should not** leave your project directory. For example, `../build` is an **invalid** directory.

# env

> This is a legacy API and no longer recommended. It is still supported for backward compatibility.

> Since the release of [Next.js 9.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4) we now have a more intuitive and ergonomic experience for [adding environment variables](/docs/app/guides/environment-variables). Give it a try!

> **Good to know**: environment variables specified in this way will **always** be included in the JavaScript bundle, prefixing the environment variable name with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` only has an effect when specifying them [through the environment or .env files](/docs/app/guides/environment-variables).

To add environment variables to the JavaScript bundle, open `next.config.js` and add the `env` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  env: {
    customKey: 'my-value',
  },
}
```

Now you can access `process.env.customKey` in your code. For example:

```jsx
function Page() {
  return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>
}

export default Page
```

Next.js will replace `process.env.customKey` with `'my-value'` at build time. Trying to destructure `process.env` variables won't work due to the nature of webpack [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/).

For example, the following line:

```jsx
return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>
```

Will end up being:

```jsx
return <h1>The value of customKey is: {'my-value'}</h1>
```

# expireTime

You can specify a custom `stale-while-revalidate` expire time for CDNs to consume in the `Cache-Control` header for ISR enabled pages.

Open `next.config.js` and add the `expireTime` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // one hour in seconds
  expireTime: 3600,
}
```

Now when sending the `Cache-Control` header the expire time will be calculated depending on the specific revalidate period.

For example, if you have a revalidate of 15 minutes on a path and the expire time is one hour the generated `Cache-Control` header will be `s-maxage=900, stale-while-revalidate=2700` so that it can stay stale for 15 minutes less than the configured expire time.
