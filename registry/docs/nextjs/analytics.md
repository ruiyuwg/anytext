# Analytics

Next.js has built-in support for measuring and reporting performance metrics. You can either use the [`useReportWebVitals`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals) hook to manage reporting yourself, or alternatively, Vercel provides a [managed service](https://vercel.com/analytics?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) to automatically collect and visualize metrics for you.

## Client Instrumentation

For more advanced analytics and monitoring needs, Next.js provides a `instrumentation-client.js|ts` file that runs before your application's frontend code starts executing. This is ideal for setting up global analytics, error tracking, or performance monitoring tools.

To use it, create an `instrumentation-client.js` or `instrumentation-client.ts` file in your application's root directory:

```js filename="instrumentation-client.js"
// Initialize analytics before the app starts
console.log("Analytics initialized");

// Set up global error tracking
window.addEventListener("error", (event) => {
  // Send to your error tracking service
  reportError(event.error);
});
```

## Build Your Own

```jsx filename="app/_components/web-vitals.js"
"use client";

import { useReportWebVitals } from "next/web-vitals";

export function WebVitals() {
  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {
    console.log(metric);
  });
}
```

```jsx filename="app/layout.js"
import { WebVitals } from "./_components/web-vitals";

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <WebVitals />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

> Since the `useReportWebVitals` hook requires the `'use client'` directive, the most performant approach is to create a separate component that the root layout imports. This confines the client boundary exclusively to the `WebVitals` component.

View the [API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals) for more information.

## Web Vitals

[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) are a set of useful metrics that aim to capture the user
experience of a web page. The following web vitals are all included:

- [Time to First Byte](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte) (TTFB)
- [First Contentful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint) (FCP)
- [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP)
- [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/) (FID)
- [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS)
- [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/inp/) (INP)

You can handle all the results of these metrics using the `name` property.

```tsx filename="app/_components/web-vitals.tsx" switcher
"use client";

import { useReportWebVitals } from "next/web-vitals";

export function WebVitals() {
  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {
    switch (metric.name) {
      case "FCP": {
        // handle FCP results
      }
      case "LCP": {
        // handle LCP results
      }
      // ...
    }
  });
}
```

```jsx filename="app/_components/web-vitals.js" switcher
"use client";

import { useReportWebVitals } from "next/web-vitals";

export function WebVitals() {
  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {
    switch (metric.name) {
      case "FCP": {
        // handle FCP results
      }
      case "LCP": {
        // handle LCP results
      }
      // ...
    }
  });
}
```

## Sending results to external systems

You can send results to any endpoint to measure and track
real user performance on your site. For example:

```js
useReportWebVitals((metric) => {
  const body = JSON.stringify(metric);
  const url = "https://example.com/analytics";

  // Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` if available, falling back to `fetch()`.
  if (navigator.sendBeacon) {
    navigator.sendBeacon(url, body);
  } else {
    fetch(url, { body, method: "POST", keepalive: true });
  }
});
```

> **Good to know**: If you use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), using the
> `id` value can allow you to construct metric distributions manually (to calculate percentiles,
> etc.)

> ```js
> useReportWebVitals((metric) => {
>   // Use `window.gtag` if you initialized Google Analytics as this example:
>   // https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-google-analytics
>   window.gtag("event", metric.name, {
>     value: Math.round(
>       metric.name === "CLS" ? metric.value * 1000 : metric.value,
>     ), // values must be integers
>     event_label: metric.id, // id unique to current page load
>     non_interaction: true, // avoids affecting bounce rate.
>   });
> });
> ```

# Authentication

# Authentication

Understanding authentication is crucial for protecting your application's data. This page will guide you through what React and Next.js features to use to implement auth.

Before starting, it helps to break down the process into three concepts:

1. **[Authentication](#authentication)**: Verifies if the user is who they say they are. It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password.
2. **[Session Management](#session-management)**: Tracks the user's auth state across requests.
3. **[Authorization](#authorization)**: Decides what routes and data the user can access.

This diagram shows the authentication flow using React and Next.js features:

![Diagram showing the authentication flow with React and Next.js features](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/docs/light/authentication-overview.png)

The examples on this page walk through basic username and password auth for educational purposes. While you can implement a custom auth solution, for increased security and simplicity, we recommend using an authentication library. These offer built-in solutions for authentication, session management, and authorization, as well as additional features such as social logins, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control. You can find a list in the [Auth Libraries](#auth-libraries) section.
