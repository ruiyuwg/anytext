# devIndicators

`devIndicators` allows you to configure the on-screen indicator that gives context about the current route you're viewing during development.

```ts filename="Types"
  devIndicators: false | {
    position?: 'bottom-right'
    | 'bottom-left'
    | 'top-right'
    | 'top-left', // defaults to 'bottom-left',
  },
```

Setting `devIndicators` to `false` will hide the indicator, however Next.js will continue to surface any build or runtime errors that were encountered.

## Troubleshooting

### Indicator not marking a route as static

If you expect a route to be static and the indicator has marked it as dynamic, it's likely the route has opted out of static rendering.

You can confirm if a route is [static](/docs/app/guides/caching#static-rendering) or [dynamic](/docs/app/guides/caching#dynamic-rendering) by building your application using `next build --debug`, and checking the output in your terminal. Static (or prerendered) routes will display a `○` symbol, whereas dynamic routes will display a `ƒ` symbol. For example:

```bash filename="Build Output"
Route (app)
┌ ○ /_not-found
└ ƒ /products/[id]

○  (Static)   prerendered as static content
ƒ  (Dynamic)  server-rendered on demand
```

When exporting [`getServerSideProps`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) or [`getInitialProps`](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props) from a page, it will be marked as dynamic.

# distDir

# distDir

You can specify a name to use for a custom build directory to use instead of `.next`.

Open `next.config.js` and add the `distDir` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  distDir: 'build',
}
```

Now if you run `next build` Next.js will use `build` instead of the default `.next` folder.

> `distDir` **should not** leave your project directory. For example, `../build` is an **invalid** directory.

> This is a legacy API and no longer recommended. It is still supported for backward compatibility.

> Since the release of [Next.js 9.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4) we now have a more intuitive and ergonomic experience for [adding environment variables](/docs/pages/guides/environment-variables). Give it a try!

> **Good to know**: environment variables specified in this way will **always** be included in the JavaScript bundle, prefixing the environment variable name with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` only has an effect when specifying them [through the environment or .env files](/docs/pages/guides/environment-variables).

To add environment variables to the JavaScript bundle, open `next.config.js` and add the `env` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  env: {
    customKey: 'my-value',
  },
}
```

Now you can access `process.env.customKey` in your code. For example:

```jsx
function Page() {
  return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>
}

export default Page
```

Next.js will replace `process.env.customKey` with `'my-value'` at build time. Trying to destructure `process.env` variables won't work due to the nature of webpack [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/).

For example, the following line:

```jsx
return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>
```

Will end up being:

```jsx
return <h1>The value of customKey is: {'my-value'}</h1>
```
