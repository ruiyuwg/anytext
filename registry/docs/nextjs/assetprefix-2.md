# assetPrefix

> **Attention**: [Deploying to Vercel](/docs/pages/getting-started/deploying) automatically configures a global CDN for your Next.js project.
> You do not need to manually setup an Asset Prefix.

> **Good to know**: Next.js 9.5+ added support for a customizable [Base Path](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/basePath), which is better
> suited for hosting your application on a sub-path like `/docs`.
> We do not suggest you use a custom Asset Prefix for this use case.

## Set up a CDN

To set up a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), you can set up an asset prefix and configure your CDN's origin to resolve to the domain that Next.js is hosted on.

Open `next.config.mjs` and add the `assetPrefix` config based on the [phase](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js#async-configuration):

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
// @ts-check
import { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from 'next/constants'

export default (phase) => {
  const isDev = phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER
  /**
   * @type {import('next').NextConfig}
   */
  const nextConfig = {
    assetPrefix: isDev ? undefined : 'https://cdn.mydomain.com',
  }
  return nextConfig
}
```

Next.js will automatically use your asset prefix for the JavaScript and CSS files it loads from the `/_next/` path (`.next/static/` folder). For example, with the above configuration, the following request for a JS chunk:

```
/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js
```

Would instead become:

```
https://cdn.mydomain.com/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js
```

The exact configuration for uploading your files to a given CDN will depend on your CDN of choice. The only folder you need to host on your CDN is the contents of `.next/static/`, which should be uploaded as `_next/static/` as the above URL request indicates. **Do not upload the rest of your `.next/` folder**, as you should not expose your server code and other configuration to the public.

While `assetPrefix` covers requests to `_next/static`, it does not influence the following paths:

- Files in the [public](/docs/pages/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder) folder; if you want to serve those assets over a CDN, you'll have to introduce the prefix yourself
- `/_next/data/` requests for `getServerSideProps` pages. These requests will always be made against the main domain since they're not static.
- `/_next/data/` requests for `getStaticProps` pages. These requests will always be made against the main domain to support [Incremental Static Generation](/docs/pages/guides/incremental-static-regeneration), even if you're not using it (for consistency).

# basePath

# basePath

To deploy a Next.js application under a sub-path of a domain you can use the `basePath` config option.

`basePath` allows you to set a path prefix for the application. For example, to use `/docs` instead of `''` (an empty string, the default), open `next.config.js` and add the `basePath` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  basePath: '/docs',
}
```

> **Good to know**: This value must be set at build time and cannot be changed without re-building as the value is inlined in the client-side bundles.

### Links

When linking to other pages using `next/link` and `next/router` the `basePath` will be automatically applied.

For example, using `/about` will automatically become `/docs/about` when `basePath` is set to `/docs`.

```js
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Link href="/about">About Page</Link>
    </>
  )
}
```

Output html:

```html
<a href="/docs/about">About Page</a>
```

This makes sure that you don't have to change all links in your application when changing the `basePath` value.

### Images

When using the [`next/image`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) component, you will need to add the `basePath` in front of `src`.

For example, using `/docs/me.png` will properly serve your image when `basePath` is set to `/docs`.

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Homepage</h1>
      <Image
        src="/docs/me.png"
        alt="Picture of the author"
        width={500}
        height={500}
      />
      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
    </>
  )
}

export default Home
```

# bundlePagesRouterDependencies

# bundlePagesRouterDependencies

Enable automatic server-side dependency bundling for Pages Router applications. Matches the automatic dependency bundling in App Router.

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  bundlePagesRouterDependencies: true,
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

Explicitly opt-out certain packages from being bundled using the [`serverExternalPackages`](/docs/pages/api-reference/config/next-config-js/serverExternalPackages) option.

# compress

# compress

By default, Next.js uses `gzip` to compress rendered content and static files when using `next start` or a custom server. This is an optimization for applications that do not have compression configured. If compression is *already* configured in your application via a custom server, Next.js will not add compression.

You can check if compression is enabled and which algorithm is used by looking at the [`Accept-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) (browser accepted options) and [`Content-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding) (currently used) headers in the response.

## Disabling compression

To disable **compression**, set the `compress` config option to `false`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  compress: false,
}
```

We **do not recommend disabling compression** unless you have compression configured on your server, as compression reduces bandwidth usage and improves the performance of your application. For example, you're using [nginx](https://nginx.org/) and want to switch to `brotli`, set the `compress` option to `false` to allow nginx to handle compression.

# crossOrigin

# crossOrigin

Use the `crossOrigin` option to add a [`crossOrigin` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) in all `<script>` tags generated by the  [`next/script`](/docs/pages/guides/scripts) and [`next/head`](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head)components, and define how cross-origin requests should be handled.

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  crossOrigin: 'anonymous',
}
```

## Options

- `'anonymous'`: Adds [`crossOrigin="anonymous"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin#anonymous) attribute.
- `'use-credentials'`: Adds [`crossOrigin="use-credentials"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin#use-credentials).
