A _room_ is an arbitrary channel that sockets can `join` and `leave`. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients:

info

Please note that rooms are a **server-only** concept (i.e. the client does not have access to the list of rooms it has joined).

## Joining and leaving[​](#joining-and-leaving "Direct link to Joining and leaving")

You can call `join` to subscribe the socket to a given channel:

```
io.on("connection", (socket) => {  socket.join("some room");});
```

And then simply use `to` or `in` (they are the same) when broadcasting or emitting:

```
io.to("some room").emit("some event");
```

Or exclude a room:

```
io.except("some room").emit("some event");
```

You can also emit to several rooms at the same time:

```
io.to("room1").to("room2").to("room3").emit("some event");
```

In that case, a [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_\(set_theory\)) is performed: every socket that is at least in one of the rooms will get the event **once** (even if the socket is in two or more rooms).

You can also broadcast to a room from a given socket:

```
io.on("connection", (socket) => {  socket.to("some room").emit("some event");});
```

In that case, every socket in the room **excluding** the sender will get the event.

To leave a channel you call `leave` in the same fashion as `join`.

## Sample use cases[​](#sample-use-cases "Direct link to Sample use cases")

-   broadcast data to each device / tab of a given user

```
function computeUserIdFromHeaders(headers) {  // to be implemented}io.on("connection", async (socket) => {  const userId = await computeUserIdFromHeaders(socket.handshake.headers);  socket.join(userId);  // and then later  io.to(userId).emit("hi");});
```

-   send notifications about a given entity

```
io.on("connection", async (socket) => {  const projects = await fetchProjects(socket);  projects.forEach(project => socket.join("project:" + project.id));  // and then later  io.to("project:4321").emit("project updated");});
```

## Disconnection[​](#disconnection "Direct link to Disconnection")

Upon disconnection, sockets `leave` all the channels they were part of automatically, and no special teardown is needed on your part.

You can fetch the rooms the Socket was in by listening to the `disconnecting` event:

```
io.on("connection", socket => {  socket.on("disconnecting", () => {    console.log(socket.rooms); // the Set contains at least the socket ID  });  socket.on("disconnect", () => {    // socket.rooms.size === 0  });});
```

## With multiple Socket.IO servers[​](#with-multiple-socketio-servers "Direct link to With multiple Socket.IO servers")

Like [global broadcasting](/docs/v4/broadcasting-events/#with-multiple-socketio-servers), broadcasting to rooms also works with multiple Socket.IO servers.

You just need to replace the default [Adapter](/docs/v4/glossary/#adapter) by the Redis Adapter. More information about it [here](/docs/v4/redis-adapter/).

## Implementation details[​](#implementation-details "Direct link to Implementation details")

The "room" feature is implemented by what we call an Adapter. This Adapter is a server-side component which is responsible for:

-   storing the relationships between the Socket instances and the rooms
-   broadcasting events to all (or a subset of) clients

You can find the code of the default in-memory adapter [here](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-adapter).

Basically, it consists in two [ES6 Maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map):

-   `sids`: `Map<SocketId, Set<Room>>`
-   `rooms`: `Map<Room, Set<SocketId>>`

Calling `socket.join("the-room")` will result in:

-   in the `sids` Map, adding "the-room" to the Set identified by the socket ID
-   in the `rooms` Map, adding the socket ID in the Set identified by the string "the-room"

Those two maps are then used when broadcasting:

-   a broadcast to all sockets (`io.emit()`) loops through the `sids` Map, and send the packet to all sockets
-   a broadcast to a given room (`io.to("room21").emit()`) loops through the Set in the `rooms` Map, and sends the packet to all matching sockets

You can access those objects with:

```
// main namespaceconst rooms = io.of("/").adapter.rooms;const sids = io.of("/").adapter.sids;// custom namespaceconst rooms = io.of("/my-namespace").adapter.rooms;const sids = io.of("/my-namespace").adapter.sids;
```

Notes:

-   those objects are not meant to be directly modified, you should always use [`socket.join(...)`](/docs/v4/server-api/#socketjoinroom) and [`socket.leave(...)`](/docs/v4/server-api/#socketleaveroom) instead.
-   in a [multi-server](/docs/v4/using-multiple-nodes/) setup, the `rooms` and `sids` objects are not shared between the Socket.IO servers (a room may only "exist" on one server and not on another).

## Room events[​](#room-events "Direct link to Room events")

Starting with `socket.io@3.1.0`, the underlying Adapter will emit the following events:

-   `create-room` (argument: room)
-   `delete-room` (argument: room)
-   `join-room` (argument: room, id)
-   `leave-room` (argument: room, id)

Example:

```
io.of("/").adapter.on("create-room", (room) => {  console.log(`room ${room} was created`);});io.of("/").adapter.on("join-room", (room, id) => {  console.log(`socket ${id} has joined room ${room}`);});
```
