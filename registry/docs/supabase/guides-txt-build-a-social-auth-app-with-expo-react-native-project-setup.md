## Project setup

Before you start building you need to set up the Database and API. You can do this by starting a new Project in Supabase and then creating a "schema" inside the database.

### Create a project

1. [Create a new project](/dashboard) in the Supabase Dashboard.
2. Enter your project details.
3. Wait for the new database to launch.

### Set up the database schema

Now set up the database schema. You can use the "User Management Starter" quickstart in the SQL Editor, or you can copy/paste the SQL from below and run it.

````
1.  Go to the [SQL Editor](/dashboard/project/_/sql) page in the Dashboard.
2.  Click **User Management Starter** under the **Community > Quickstarts** tab.
3.  Click **Run**.


  You can pull the database schema down to your local project by running the `db pull` command. Read the [local development docs](/docs/guides/cli/local-development#link-your-project) for detailed instructions.

  ```bash
  supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
  # You can get <project-id> from your project's dashboard URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<project-id>
  supabase db pull
  ```





  When working locally you can run the following command to create a new migration file:


```bash
supabase migration new user_management_starter
```

```sql
-- Create a table for public profiles
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users not null primary key,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone,
  username text unique,
  full_name text,
  avatar_url text,
  website text,

  constraint username_length check (char_length(username) >= 3)
);
-- Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
-- See https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security for more details.
alter table profiles
  enable row level security;

create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone." on profiles
  for select using (true);

create policy "Users can insert their own profile." on profiles
  for insert with check ((select auth.uid()) = id);

create policy "Users can update own profile." on profiles
  for update using ((select auth.uid()) = id);

-- This trigger automatically creates a profile entry when a new user signs up via Supabase Auth.
-- See https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/managing-user-data#using-triggers for more details.
create function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger
set search_path = ''
as $$
begin
  insert into public.profiles (id, full_name, avatar_url)
  values (new.id, new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', new.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url');
  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql security definer;
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();

-- Set up Storage!
insert into storage.buckets (id, name)
  values ('avatars', 'avatars');

-- Set up access controls for storage.
-- See https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/security/access-control#policy-examples for more details.
create policy "Avatar images are publicly accessible." on storage.objects
  for select using (bucket_id = 'avatars');

create policy "Anyone can upload an avatar." on storage.objects
  for insert with check (bucket_id = 'avatars');

create policy "Anyone can update their own avatar." on storage.objects
  for update using ((select auth.uid()) = owner) with check (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```
````

### Get API details

Now that you've created some database tables, you are ready to insert data using the auto-generated API.

To do this, you need to get the Project URL and key from [the project **Connect** dialog](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true\&connectTab=mobiles\&framework=exporeactnative).

Supabase is changing the way keys work to improve project security and developer experience. You can [read the full announcement](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260), but in the transition period, you can use both the current `anon` and `service_role` keys and the new publishable key with the form `sb_publishable_xxx` which will replace the older keys.

In most cases, you can get the correct key from [the Project's **Connect** dialog](/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true\&connectTab=mobiles\&framework=exporeactnative), but if you want a specific key, you can find all keys in [the API Keys section of a Project's Settings page](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys/):

- **For legacy keys**, copy the `anon` key for client-side operations and the `service_role` key for server-side operations from the **Legacy API Keys** tab.
- **For new keys**, open the **API Keys** tab, if you don't have a publishable key already, click **Create new API Keys**, and copy the value from the **Publishable key** section.

[Read the API keys docs](/docs/guides/api/api-keys) for a full explanation of all key types and their uses.
