# onCleanup

[Edit this page](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs/edit/main/src/routes/reference/lifecycle/on-cleanup.mdx)

`onCleanup` registers a cleanup method that executes on disposal and recalculation of the current tracking scope. Can be used anywhere to clean up any side effects left behind by initialization.

When used in a Component, it runs when the component is unmounted. When used in tracking scope, such [`createEffect`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-effect), [`createMemo`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-memo) or a [`createRoot`](/reference/reactive-utilities/create-root), it runs when the tracking scope is disposed or refreshed.

```
import { onCleanup } from "solid-js"
function onCleanup(fn: () => void): void;
```

Without the `onCleanup` function, the event listener would remain attached to the `document` even after the component is removed from the page. This can cause memory leaks and other issues.

```
import { createSignal, onCleanup } from "solid-js"
const Component = () => {  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const handleClick = () => setCount((value) => value + 1);
  document.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
  /**   * Remove the event listener when the component is removed/unmounted from the page.   */  onCleanup(() => {    document.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);  });
  return <main>Document has been clicked {count()} times</main>;};
```
