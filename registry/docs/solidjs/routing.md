Building your application

# Routing

[Edit this page](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs/edit/main/src/routes/solid-start/building-your-application/routing.mdx)

Routing serves as a key component of web applications. Within SolidStart, there are two types:

- **UI routes** — define the user interface in your app
- **[API routes](/solid-start/building-your-application/api-routes)** — define the serverless functions in your app

To read more about API routes, [see the API Routes section.](/solid-start/building-your-application/api-routes)

***

## [Creating new routes](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#creating-new-routes)

SolidStart uses file based routing which is a way of defining your routes by creating files and folders in your project. This includes your pages and API routes.

SolidStart traverses your `routes` directory, collects all of the routes, and then makes them accessible using the [`<FileRoutes />`](/solid-start/reference/routing/file-routes). This component will only include your UI routes, not your API routes. Rather than manually defining each `Route` inside a `Router` component, `<FileRoutes />` will generate the routes for you based on the file system.

Because `<FileRoutes />` returns a routing config object, you can use it with the router of your choice. In this example, we use [`solid-router`](/solid-router):

```
import { Suspense } from "solid-js";import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";import { FileRoutes } from "@solidjs/start/router";
export default function App() {  return (    <Router root={(props) => <Suspense>{props.children}</Suspense>}>      <FileRoutes />    </Router>  );}
```

The `<Router />` component expects a `root` prop which functions as the root layout of your entire app. You will want to make sure `props.children` is wrapped in `<Suspense />` since each component will be lazy-loaded automatically. Without this, you could see some unexpected hydration errors.

`<FileRoutes />` will generate a route for each file in the `routes` directory and its subdirectories. For a route to be rendered as a page, it must default export a component. This component represents the content that will be rendered when users visit the page:

```
export default function Index() {  return <div>Welcome to my site!</div>;}
```

This means that all you have to do is create a file in your `routes` folder and SolidStart takes care of everything else needed to make that route available to visit in your application!

***

## [File based routing](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#file-based-routing)

Each file in the `routes` directory is treated as a route. To create a new route or page in your application, simply create a new file in the `routes` directory. The file name will be the URL path for the route:

- `example.com/blog` ➜ `/routes/blog.tsx`
- `example.com/contact` ➜ `/routes/contact.tsx`
- `example.com/directions` ➜ `/routes/directions.tsx`

### [Nested routes](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#nested-routes)

If you need nested routes, you can create a directory with the name of the preceding route segment, and create new files in that directory:

- `example.com/blog/article-1` ➜ `/routes/blog/article-1.tsx`
- `example.com/work/job-1` ➜ `/routes/work/job-1.tsx`

When a file is named `index`, it will be rendered when there are no additional URL route segments being requested for a matching directory:

- `example.com` ➜ `/routes/index.tsx`
- `example.com/socials` ➜ `/routes/socials/index.tsx`

### [Nested layouts](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#nested-layouts)

If you want to create nested layouts you can create a file with the same name as a route folder.

```
|-- routes/    |-- blog.tsx                   // layout file    |-- blog/        |-- article-1.tsx         // example.com/blog/article-1        |-- article-2.tsx        // example.com/blog/article-2
```

In this case, the `blog.tsx` file will act as a layout for the articles in the `blog` folder. You can reference the child's content by using `props.children` in the layout.

TypeScriptJavaScript

```
// routes/blog.tsximport { RouteSectionProps } from "@solidjs/router";
export default function BlogLayout(props: RouteSectionProps) {  return <div>{props.children}</div>;}
```

```
// routes/blog.jsxexport default function BlogLayout(props) {  return <div>{props.children}</div>;}
```

**Note**: Creating a `blog/index.tsx` or `blog/(blogIndex).tsx` is not the same as it would only be used for the index route.

***

## [Renaming Index](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#renaming-index)

By default, the component that is rendered for a route comes from the default export of the `index.tsx` file in each folder. However, this can make it difficult to find the correct `index.tsx` file when searching, since there will be multiple files with that name.

To avoid this, you can rename the `index.tsx` file to the name of the folder it is in, enclosed in parentheses.

This way, it will be treated as the default export for that route:

```
|-- routes/                       // example.com    |-- blog/        |-- article-1.tsx         // example.com/blog/article-1        |-- article-2.tsx    |-- work/        |-- job-1.tsx             // example.com/work/job-1        |-- job-2.tsx    |-- socials/        |-- (socials).tsx           // example.com/socials
```

#### [Escaping nested routes](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#escaping-nested-routes)

When you have a path that is nested but wish for it to have a separate Layout, you can escape the nested route by applying a name between `( )`. This will allow you to create a new route that is not nested under the previous route:

```
|-- routes/                       // example.com    |-- users/        |-- index.tsx            // example.com/users        |-- projects.tsx         // example.com/users/projects    |-- users(details)/        |-- [id].tsx            // example.com/users/1
```

Additionally, you can incorporate nested layouts of their own:

```
|-- routes/    |-- users.tsx    |-- users(details).tsx    |-- users/        |-- index.tsx        |-- projects.tsx    |-- users(details)/        |-- [id].tsx
```

### [Dynamic routes](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#dynamic-routes)

Dynamic routes are routes that can match any value for one segment of the route. When your URL path contains a dynamic segment, square brackets (`[]`) are used to define the dynamic segment:

- `example.com/users/:id` ➜ `/routes/users/[id].tsx`
- `example.com/users/:id/:name` ➜ `/routes/users/[id]/[name].tsx`
- `example.com/*missing` ➜ `/routes/[...missing].tsx`

This allows you to create a single route that can match any value for that segment of the URL path. For example, `/users/1` and `/users/2` are both valid routes and rather than defining separate routes for each user, you can use a dynamic route to match any value for the `id` segment.

```
|-- routes/    |-- users/        |-- [id].tsx
```

For example, using `solid-router`, you could use the [`useParams`](/solid-router/reference/primitives/use-params) primitive to match the dynamic segment:

```
import { useParams } from "@solidjs/router";
export default function UserPage() {  const params = useParams();  return <div>User {params.id}</div>;}
```

#### [Optional parameter](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#optional-parameter)

If you have optional parameters in your route, you can use the double square brackets (`[[id]]`) to define the dynamic segment. This will match a route with or without a parameter.

```
|-- routes/    |-- users/        |-- [[id]].tsx
```

In this case, some pages that could be matched include:

- `/users`
- `/users/1`
- `/users/abc`

#### [Catch-all routes](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#catch-all-routes)

Catch-all routes are a special type of dynamic route that can match any number of segments. They are defined using square brackets with `...` before the label for the route (e.g. `[...post]`).

```
|-- routes/    |-- blog/        |-- index.tsx        |-- [...post].tsx
```

A catch-all route will have one parameter which is a forward-slash delimited string of all the URL segments after the last valid segment. For example, with the route `[...post]` and a URL path of `/post/foo` the `params` object returned from the `useParams` primitive will have a `post` property with the value of `post/foo`. For a URL path of `/post/foo/baz` it will be `post/foo/baz`.

```
import { useParams } from "@solidjs/router";
export default function BlogPage() {  const params = useParams();  return <div>Blog {params.post}</div>;}
```

***

## [Route groups](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#route-groups)

Using route groups, you can organize your routes in a way that makes sense for your application, without affecting the URL structure. Since file-based routing is based on the file system, it can be difficult to organize your routes in a way that makes sense for your application.

In SolidStart, route groups are defined by using parenthesis (`()`) surrounding the folder name:

```
|-- routes/    |-- (static)        |-- about-us                // example.com/about-us            |-- index.tsx        |-- contact-us              // example.com/contact-us            |-- index.tsx
```

***

## [Additional route config](/solid-start/building-your-application/routing#additional-route-config)

SolidStart offers a way to add additional route configuration outside of the file system. Since SolidStart supports the use of other routers, you can use the `route` export provided by `<FileRoutes />` to define the route configuration for the router of your choice.

TypeScriptJavaScript

```
import type { RouteSectionProps, RouteDefinition } from "@solidjs/router";
export const route = {  preload() {    // define preload function  }} satisfies RouteDefinition
export default function UsersLayout(props: RouteSectionProps) {  return (    <div>      <h1>Users</h1>      {props.children}    </div>  );}
```

```
export const route = {  preload() {    // define preload function  },};
export default function UsersLayout(props) {  return (    <div>      <h1>Users</h1>      {props.children}    </div>  );}
```
