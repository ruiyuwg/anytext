# Handling Verified Bots

> **💡 Note:** Handling verified bots is available in botid@1.5.0 and above.

BotID allows you to identify and handle [verified bots](/docs/bot-management#verified-bots) differently from regular bots. This feature enables you to permit certain trusted bots (like AI assistants) to access your application while blocking others.

Vercel maintains a directory of known and verified bots across the web at [bots.fyi](https://bots.fyi)

### Checking for Verified Bots

When using `checkBotId()`, the response includes fields that help you identify verified bots:

```javascript
import { checkBotId } from "botid/server";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const botResult = await checkBotId();

  const { isBot, verifiedBotName, isVerifiedBot, verifiedBotCategory } = botResult;

  // Check if it's ChatGPT Operator
  const isOperator = isVerifiedBot && verifiedBotName === "chatgpt-operator";

  if (isBot && !isOperator) {
    return Response.json({ error: "Access denied" }, { status: 403 });
  }

  // ... rest of your handler
  return Response.json(botResult);
}
```

### Verified Bot response fields

View our directory of verified bot names and categories [here](/docs/bot-management#verified-bots-directory).

The `checkBotId()` function returns the following fields for verified bots:

- **`isVerifiedBot`**: Boolean indicating whether the bot is verified
- **`verifiedBotName`**: String identifying the specific verified bot
- **`verifiedBotCategory`**: String categorizing the type of verified bot

### Example use cases

Verified bots are useful when you want to:

- Allow AI assistants to interact with your API while blocking other bots
- Provide different responses or functionality for verified bots
- Track usage by specific verified bot services
- Enable AI-powered features while maintaining security
