## Operation description

-   You cannot delete the active Cloud Backup clients that receive heartbeat packets within 1 hour. You can call the UninstallBackupClients operation to uninstall a Cloud Backup client. Then, the client becomes inactive.
    
-   When you perform this operation, resources that are associated with the client are also deleted, including:
    
    -   Backup plans
        
    -   Backup jobs
        
    -   Snapshots

## **RAM authorization**

The table below describes the authorization required to call this API. You can define it in a Resource Access Management (RAM) policy. The table's columns are detailed below:

-   Action: The actions can be used in the `Action` element of RAM permission policy statements to grant permissions to perform the operation.
    
-   API: The API that you can call to perform the action.
    
-   Access level: The predefined level of access granted for each API. Valid values: create, list, get, update, and delete.
    
-   Resource type: The type of the resource that supports authorization to perform the action. It indicates if the action supports resource-level permission. The specified resource must be compatible with the action. Otherwise, the policy will be ineffective.
    
    -   For APIs with resource-level permissions, required resource types are marked with an asterisk (\*). Specify the corresponding Alibaba Cloud Resource Name (ARN) in the `Resource` element of the policy.
        
    -   For APIs without resource-level permissions, it is shown as All Resources. Use an asterisk (**\***) in the `Resource` element of the policy.
        
-   Condition key: The condition keys defined by the service. The key allows for granular control, applying to either actions alone or actions associated with specific resources. In addition to service-specific condition keys, Alibaba Cloud provides a set of [common condition keys](/help/en/ram/policy-elements#section-jix-u0j-2ms) applicable across all RAM-supported services.
    
-   Dependent action: The dependent actions required to run the action. To complete the action, the RAM user or the RAM role must have the permissions to perform all dependent actions.
