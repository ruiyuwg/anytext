A bucket is a container that stores objects in Object Storage Service (OSS). All objects must be stored in a bucket. This topic describes how to determine whether a specific bucket exists.

## Usage notes

-   In this topic, the public endpoint of the China (Hangzhou) region is used. To access OSS from other Alibaba Cloud services in the same region, use an internal endpoint. For details about supported regions and endpoints, see [OSS regions and endpoints](/help/en/oss/user-guide/regions-and-endpoints#concept-zt4-cvy-5db).
    
-   In this topic, access credentials are obtained from environment variables. For more information about how to configure access credentials, see [Configure access credentials](/help/en/oss/developer-reference/oss-java-configure-access-credentials#main-2350752).
    
-   In this topic, an OSSClient instance is created by using an OSS endpoint. If you want to create an OSSClient instance by using custom domain names or Security Token Service (STS), see [Configuration examples for common scenarios](/help/en/oss/developer-reference/initialization-3#section-ngr-tjb-kfb).
    
-   To determine whether a bucket exists, you must have the `oss:GetBucketAcl` permission. For more information, see [Attach a custom policy to a RAM user](/help/en/oss/user-guide/common-examples-of-ram-policies#section-ucu-jv0-zip).
    

## Sample code

The following code provides an example of how to determine whether a bucket named examplebucket exists:

```
import com.aliyun.oss.*;
import com.aliyun.oss.common.auth.*;
import com.aliyun.oss.common.comm.SignVersion;

public class Demo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // The endpoint of the China (Hangzhou) region is used in this example. Specify your actual endpoint.
        String endpoint = "https://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com";
        // Specify the region where the bucket is located. For example, if the bucket is in the China (Hangzhou) region, set the region to cn-hangzhou.
        String region = "cn-hangzhou";

        // Obtain access credentials from environment variables. Before you run the sample code, make sure that the OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET environment variables are configured.
        EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = CredentialsProviderFactory.newEnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider();

        // Create an OSSClient instance.
        // When the OSSClient instance is no longer used, call the shutdown method to release resources.
        ClientBuilderConfiguration clientBuilderConfiguration = new ClientBuilderConfiguration();
        clientBuilderConfiguration.setSignatureVersion(SignVersion.V4);
        OSS ossClient = OSSClientBuilder.create()
                .endpoint(endpoint)
                .credentialsProvider(credentialsProvider)
                .clientConfiguration(clientBuilderConfiguration)
                .region(region)
                .build();

        try {
            // Check whether the bucket named examplebucket exists. If true is returned, the bucket exists. If false is returned, the bucket does not exist.
            boolean exists = ossClient.doesBucketExist("examplebucket");
            System.out.println(exists);
        } catch (OSSException oe) {
            System.out.println("Caught an OSSException, which means your request made it to OSS, "
                    + "but was rejected with an error response for some reason.");
            System.out.println("Error Message:" + oe.getErrorMessage());
            System.out.println("Error Code:" + oe.getErrorCode());
            System.out.println("Request ID:" + oe.getRequestId());
            System.out.println("Host ID:" + oe.getHostId());
        } catch (ClientException ce) {
            System.out.println("Caught an ClientException, which means the client encountered "
                    + "a serious internal problem while trying to communicate with OSS, "
                    + "such as not being able to access the network.");
            System.out.println("Error Message:" + ce.getMessage());
        } finally {
            if (ossClient != null) {
                ossClient.shutdown();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
