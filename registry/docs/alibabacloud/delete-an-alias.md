You can delete aliases that are no longer used. If you delete an alias, the CMK for which the alias is created is not affected.

## Background information

If you want to allow a Resource Access Management (RAM) user to delete an alias, you must create a custom policy to grant the RAM user the required permissions.

The following sample policy allows User 123456 to delete the `alias/example` alias from CMK 127d2f84-ee5f-4f4d-9d41-dbc1aca2\*\*\*\*:

```
{
  "Version": "1",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "kms:DeleteAlias"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "acs:kms:cn-hangzhou:123456:key/127d2f84-ee5f-4f4d-9d41-dbc1aca2****",
        "acs:kms:cn-hangzhou:123456:alias/example"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Delete an alias in the KMS console

1.  Log on to the [KMS console](https://yundun.console.alibabacloud.com/?p=kms).
    
2.  In the top navigation bar, select the region where your CMK resides.
    
3.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Resource** > **Keys**.
    
4.  Find the CMK whose CMK you want to delete and click the CMK ID.
    
5.  On the page that appears, find the alias that you want to delete in the **Aliases** section and click **Delete Alias**.
    
6.  In the **Delete Alias** message, click **OK**.
    

## Delete an alias by calling an API operation
