A bucket policy is an authorization policy for buckets in Object Storage Service (OSS). It lets you grant or restrict fine-grained access to specified OSS resources for authenticated visitors, such as Alibaba Cloud accounts, Resource Access Management (RAM) users, and RAM roles, or for anonymous visitors. For example, you can grant read-only permissions on specified OSS resources to a RAM user that belongs to another Alibaba Cloud account.

## Precautions

-   Before you configure a bucket policy, ensure that you understand this feature. For more information, see [Bucket policies](/help/en/oss/user-guide/oss-bucket-policy/).
    

-   In this topic, the public endpoint of the China (Hangzhou) region is used. To access OSS from other Alibaba Cloud services in the same region, use an internal endpoint. For details about supported regions and endpoints, see [OSS regions and endpoints](/help/en/oss/user-guide/regions-and-endpoints#concept-zt4-cvy-5db).
    
-   In this topic, access credentials are obtained from environment variables. For more information about how to configure access credentials, see [Configure access credentials](/help/en/oss/developer-reference/oss-java-configure-access-credentials#main-2350752).
    
-   In this topic, an OSSClient instance is created by using an OSS endpoint. If you want to create an OSSClient instance by using custom domain names or Security Token Service (STS), see [Configuration examples for common scenarios](/help/en/oss/developer-reference/initialization-3#section-ngr-tjb-kfb).
    
-   To set a bucket policy, you must have the `oss:PutBucketPolicy` permission. To retrieve a bucket policy, you must have the `oss:GetBucketPolicy` permission. To delete a bucket policy, you must have the `oss:DeleteBucketPolicy` permission. For more information, see [Attach a custom policy to a RAM user](/help/en/oss/user-guide/common-examples-of-ram-policies#section-ucu-jv0-zip).
    

## Set a bucket policy

The following code shows how to set a bucket policy:

```
import com.aliyun.oss.*;
import com.aliyun.oss.common.auth.*;
import com.aliyun.oss.common.comm.SignVersion;

public class Demo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // In this example, the endpoint of the China (Hangzhou) region is used. Specify your actual endpoint.
        String endpoint = "https://oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com";
        // Obtain access credentials from environment variables. Before you run the sample code, make sure that the OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET environment variables are configured.
        EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = CredentialsProviderFactory.newEnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider();
        // Specify the bucket name, for example, examplebucket.
        String bucketName = "examplebucket";
        // Specify the region in which the bucket is located. For example, if the bucket is located in the China (Hangzhou) region, set the region to cn-hangzhou.
        String region = "cn-hangzhou";
        
        // Create an OSSClient instance.
        // When the OSSClient instance is no longer used, call the shutdown method to release resources.
        ClientBuilderConfiguration clientBuilderConfiguration = new ClientBuilderConfiguration();
        clientBuilderConfiguration.setSignatureVersion(SignVersion.V4);        
        OSS ossClient = OSSClientBuilder.create()
        .endpoint(endpoint)
        .credentialsProvider(credentialsProvider)
        .clientConfiguration(clientBuilderConfiguration)
        .region(region)               
        .build();

        try {
            // In the following example, the bucket owner (UID 174649585760xxxx) uses a bucket policy to grant a RAM user (UID 20214760404935xxxx) the permissions to get and list objects in the examplebucket bucket.
            String policyText = "{\"Statement\": [{\"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [\"oss:GetObject\", \"oss:ListObjects\"], \"Principal\": [\"20214760404935xxxx\"], \"Resource\": [\"acs:oss:*:174649585760xxxx:examplebucket/*\"]}], \"Version\": \"1\"}";

            ossClient.setBucketPolicy(bucketName, policyText);
        } catch (OSSException oe) {
            System.out.println("Caught an OSSException, which means your request made it to OSS, "
                    + "but was rejected with an error response for some reason.");
            System.out.println("Error Message:" + oe.getErrorMessage());
            System.out.println("Error Code:" + oe.getErrorCode());
            System.out.println("Request ID:" + oe.getRequestId());
            System.out.println("Host ID:" + oe.getHostId());
        } catch (ClientException ce) {
            System.out.println("Caught an ClientException, which means the client encountered "
                    + "a serious internal problem while trying to communicate with OSS, "
                    + "such as not being able to access the network.");
            System.out.println("Error Message:" + ce.getMessage());
        } finally {
            if (ossClient != null) {
