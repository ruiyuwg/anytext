Locks a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device that is in the NORMAL state.

## Operation description

After a virtual MFA device is locked, its status changes to LOCKED. The Active Directory (AD) user who uses the virtual MFA device is unable to pass MFA and is therefore unable to log on to the client. You can call the [UnlockVirtualMFADevice](/help/en/wuying-workspace/unlockvirtualmfadevice) operation to unlock the device.
