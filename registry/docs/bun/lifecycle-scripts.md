# Lifecycle scripts

How Bun handles package lifecycle scripts securely

Packages on `npm` can define *lifecycle scripts* in their `package.json`. Some of the most common are below, but there are [many others](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts).

- `preinstall`: Runs before the package is installed
- `postinstall`: Runs after the package is installed
- `preuninstall`: Runs before the package is uninstalled
- `prepublishOnly`: Runs before the package is published

These scripts are arbitrary shell commands that the package manager is expected to read and execute at the appropriate time. But executing arbitrary scripts represents a potential security risk, so—unlike other `npm` clients—Bun does not execute arbitrary lifecycle scripts by default.

***

## `postinstall`

The `postinstall` script is particularly important. It's widely used to build or install platform-specific binaries for packages that are implemented as [native Node.js add-ons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html). For example, `node-sass` is a popular package that uses `postinstall` to build a native binary for Sass.

```json package.json icon="file-json" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "node-sass": "^6.0.1"
  }
}
```

***

## `trustedDependencies`

Instead of executing arbitrary scripts, Bun uses a "default-secure" approach. You can add certain packages to an allow list, and Bun will execute lifecycle scripts for those packages. To tell Bun to allow lifecycle scripts for a particular package, add the package name to `trustedDependencies` array in your `package.json`.

```json package.json icon="file-json" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "trustedDependencies": ["node-sass"] // [!code ++]
}
```

Once added to `trustedDependencies`, install/re-install the package. Bun will read this field and run lifecycle scripts for `my-trusted-package`.

The top 500 npm packages with lifecycle scripts are allowed by default. You can see the full list [here](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/main/src/install/default-trusted-dependencies.txt).

The default trusted dependencies list only applies to packages installed from npm. For packages from other sources
(such as `file:`, `link:`, `git:`, or `github:` dependencies), you must explicitly add them to `trustedDependencies`
to run their lifecycle scripts, even if the package name matches an entry in the default list. This prevents malicious
packages from spoofing trusted package names through local file paths or git repositories.

***

## `--ignore-scripts`

To disable lifecycle scripts for all packages, use the `--ignore-scripts` flag.

```bash terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun install --ignore-scripts
```

# Lockfile

Source: https://bun.com/docs/pm/lockfile

Bun's lockfile format and configuration

Running `bun install` will create a lockfile called `bun.lock`.

#### Should it be committed to git?

Yes

#### Generate a lockfile without installing?

To generate a lockfile without installing to `node_modules` you can use the `--lockfile-only` flag. The lockfile will always be saved to disk, even if it is up-to-date with the `package.json`(s) for your project.

```bash terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun install --lockfile-only
```

Using `--lockfile-only` will still populate the global install cache with registry metadata and git/tarball
dependencies.

#### Can I opt out?

To install without creating a lockfile:

```bash terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun install --no-save
```

To install a Yarn lockfile *in addition* to `bun.lock`.

```bash terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun install --yarn
```

```toml bunfig.toml icon="settings" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
[install.lockfile]
# whether to save a non-Bun lockfile alongside bun.lock
# only "yarn" is supported
print = "yarn"
```

#### Text-based lockfile

Bun v1.2 changed the default lockfile format to the text-based `bun.lock`. Existing binary `bun.lockb` lockfiles can be migrated to the new format by running `bun install --save-text-lockfile --frozen-lockfile --lockfile-only` and deleting `bun.lockb`.

More information about the new lockfile format can be found on [our blogpost](https://bun.com/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile).

#### Automatic lockfile migration

When running `bun install` in a project without a `bun.lock`, Bun automatically migrates existing lockfiles:

- `yarn.lock` (v1)
- `package-lock.json` (npm)
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm)

The original lockfile is preserved and can be removed manually after verification.
