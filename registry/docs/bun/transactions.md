## Transactions

To start a new transaction, use `sql.begin`. This method works for both PostgreSQL and SQLite. For PostgreSQL, it reserves a dedicated connection from the pool. For SQLite, it begins a transaction on the single connection.

The `BEGIN` command is sent automatically, including any optional configurations you specify. If an error occurs during the transaction, a `ROLLBACK` is triggered to ensure the process continues smoothly.

### Basic Transactions

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
await sql.begin(async tx => {
  // All queries in this function run in a transaction
  await tx`INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (${"Alice"})`;
  await tx`UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE user_id = 1`;

  // Transaction automatically commits if no errors are thrown
  // Rolls back if any error occurs
});
```

It's also possible to pipeline the requests in a transaction if needed by returning an array with queries from the callback function like this:

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
await sql.begin(async tx => {
  return [
    tx`INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (${"Alice"})`,
    tx`UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE user_id = 1`,
  ];
});
```

### Savepoints

Savepoints in SQL create intermediate checkpoints within a transaction, enabling partial rollbacks without affecting the entire operation. They are useful in complex transactions, allowing error recovery and maintaining consistent results.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
await sql.begin(async tx => {
  await tx`INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (${"Alice"})`;

  await tx.savepoint(async sp => {
    // This part can be rolled back separately
    await sp`UPDATE users SET status = 'active'`;
    if (someCondition) {
      throw new Error("Rollback to savepoint");
    }
  });

  // Continue with transaction even if savepoint rolled back
  await tx`INSERT INTO audit_log (action) VALUES ('user_created')`;
});
```

### Distributed Transactions

Two-Phase Commit (2PC) is a distributed transaction protocol where Phase 1 has the coordinator preparing nodes by ensuring data is written and ready to commit, while Phase 2 finalizes with nodes either committing or rolling back based on the coordinator's decision. This process ensures data durability and proper lock management.

In PostgreSQL and MySQL, distributed transactions persist beyond their original session, allowing privileged users or coordinators to commit or rollback them later. This supports robust distributed transactions, recovery processes, and administrative operations.

Each database system implements distributed transactions differently:

PostgreSQL natively supports them through prepared transactions, while MySQL uses XA Transactions.

If any exceptions occur during the distributed transaction and aren't caught, the system will automatically rollback all changes. When everything proceeds normally, you maintain the flexibility to either commit or rollback the transaction later.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
// Begin a distributed transaction
await sql.beginDistributed("tx1", async tx => {
  await tx`INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (${"Alice"})`;
});

// Later, commit or rollback
await sql.commitDistributed("tx1");
// or
await sql.rollbackDistributed("tx1");
```
