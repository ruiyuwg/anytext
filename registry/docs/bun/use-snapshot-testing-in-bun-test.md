# Use snapshot testing in `bun test`

Source: https://bun.com/docs/guides/test/snapshot

Bun's test runner supports Jest-style snapshot testing via `.toMatchSnapshot()`.

```ts snap.test.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/nIz6GtMH5K-dfXeV/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=nIz6GtMH5K-dfXeV&q=85&s=5d73d76daf7eb7b158469d8c30d349b0" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("snapshot", () => {
  expect({ foo: "bar" }).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

***

The first time this test is executed, Bun will evaluate the value passed into `expect()` and write it to disk in a directory called `__snapshots__` that lives alongside the test file. (Note the `snapshots: +1 added` line in the output.)

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test test/snap
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
test/snap.test.ts:
✓ snapshot [1.48ms]

 1 pass
 0 fail
 snapshots: +1 added
 1 expect() calls
Ran 1 tests across 1 files. [82.00ms]
```

***

The `__snapshots__` directory contains a `.snap` file for each test file in the directory.

```txt File Tree icon="folder-tree" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
test
├── __snapshots__
│   └── snap.test.ts.snap
└── snap.test.ts
```

***

The `snap.test.ts.snap` file is a JavaScript file that exports a serialized version of the value passed into `expect()`. The `{foo: "bar"}` object has been serialized to JSON.

```js snap.test.ts.snap icon="file-code" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
// Bun Snapshot v1, https://bun.com/docs/test/snapshots

exports[`snapshot 1`] = `
{
  "foo": "bar",
}
`;
```

***

Later, when this test file is executed again, Bun will read the snapshot file and compare it to the value passed into `expect()`. If the values are different, the test will fail.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test v1.3.3 (9c68abdb)
test/snap.test.ts:
✓ snapshot [1.05ms]

 1 pass
 0 fail
 1 snapshots, 1 expect() calls
Ran 1 tests across 1 files. [101.00ms]
```

***

To update snapshots, use the `--update-snapshots` flag.

```sh terminal icon="terminal" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test --update-snapshots
```

```txt theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
bun test v1.3.3 (9c68abdb)
test/snap.test.ts:
✓ snapshot [0.86ms]

 1 pass
 0 fail
 snapshots: +1 added  # the snapshot was regenerated
 1 expect() calls
Ran 1 tests across 1 files. [102.00ms]
```

# Spy on methods in `bun test`

Source: https://bun.com/docs/guides/test/spy-on

Use the `spyOn` utility to track method calls with Bun's test runner.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
import { test, expect, spyOn } from "bun:test";

const leo = {
  name: "Leonardo",
  sayHi(thing: string) {
    console.log(`Sup I'm ${this.name} and I like ${thing}`);
  },
};

const spy = spyOn(leo, "sayHi");
```

***

Once the spy is created, it can be used to write `expect` assertions relating to method calls.

```ts theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
import { test, expect, spyOn } from "bun:test";

const leo = {
  name: "Leonardo",
  sayHi(thing: string) {
    console.log(`Sup I'm ${this.name} and I like ${thing}`);
  },
};

const spy = spyOn(leo, "sayHi");

test("turtles", () => { // [!code ++]
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0); // [!code ++]
  leo.sayHi("pizza"); // [!code ++]
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1); // [!code ++]
  expect(spy.mock.calls).toEqual([["pizza"]]); // [!code ++]
}); // [!code ++]
```
