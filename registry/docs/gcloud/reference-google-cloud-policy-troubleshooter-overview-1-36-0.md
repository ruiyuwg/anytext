# google-cloud-policy-troubleshooter overview (1.36.0)

## Key Reference Links

**IAM Policy Troubleshooter API Description:** Makes it easier to understand why a user has access to a resource or doesn't have permission to call an API. Given an email, resource, and permission, Policy Troubleshooter examines all Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies that apply to the resource. It then reveals whether the member's roles include the permission on that resource and, if so, which policies bind the member to those roles.

[Maven artifact](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.google.cloud/google-cloud-policy-troubleshooter)

## Getting Started

In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:

-   [Install a JDK (Java Development Kit)](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/setup#install_a_jdk_java_development_kit)
-   [Select or create a Cloud Platform project](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
-   [Enable billing for your project](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#enable_billing_for_a_project)
-   [Enable the API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/policytroubleshooter.googleapis.com)
-   [Set up authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/client-libraries)

## Use the IAM Policy Troubleshooter API for Java

To ensure that your project uses compatible versions of the libraries and their component artifacts, import `com.google.cloud:libraries-bom` and use the BOM to specify dependency versions. Be sure to remove any versions that you set previously. For more information about BOMs, see [Google Cloud Platform Libraries BOM](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/bom).

### Maven

Import the BOM in the `dependencyManagement` section of your `pom.xml` file. Include specific artifacts you depend on in the `dependencies` section, but don't specify the artifacts' versions in the `dependencies` section.

The example below demonstrates how you would import the BOM and include the `google-cloud-policy-troubleshooter` artifact.

<dependencyManagement>
 <dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>libraries-bom</artifactId>
      <version>  26.34.0</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
   </dependency>
 </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
 <dependency>
   <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
   <artifactId>google-cloud-policy-troubleshooter</artifactId>
 </dependency>
</dependencies>

### Gradle

BOMs are supported by default in Gradle 5.x or later. Add a `platform` dependency on `com.google.cloud:libraries-bom` and remove the version from the dependency declarations in the artifact's `build.gradle` file.

The example below demonstrates how you would import the BOM and include the `google-cloud-policy-troubleshooter` artifact.

implementation platform('com.google.cloud:libraries-bom:  26.34.0')
implementation 'com.google.cloud:google-cloud-policy-troubleshooter'

The `platform` and `enforcedPlatform` keywords supply dependency versions declared in a BOM. The `enforcedPlatform` keyword enforces the dependency versions declared in the BOM and thus overrides what you specified.

For more details of the `platform` and `enforcedPlatform` keywords Gradle 5.x or higher, see [Gradle: Importing Maven BOMs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:bom_import).

If you're using Gradle 4.6 or later, add `enableFeaturePreview('IMPROVED_POM_SUPPORT')` to your `settings.gradle` file. For details, see [Gradle 4.6 Release Notes: BOM import](https://docs.gradle.org/4.6/release-notes.html#bom-import). Versions of Gradle earlier than 4.6 don't support BOMs.

### SBT

SBT [doesn't support BOMs](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/4531). You can find recommended versions of libraries from a particular BOM version on the [dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-opensource-java-dashboard/com.google.cloud/libraries-bom/index.html) and set the versions manually. To use the latest version of this library, add this to your dependencies:

libraryDependencies += "com.google.cloud" % "google-cloud-policy-troubleshooter" % "1.36.0"

## Which version should I use?

For this library, we recommend using API version v3 for new applications.

Each Cloud Java client library may contain multiple packages. Each package containing a version number in its name corresponds to a published version of the service. We recommend using the latest stable version for new production applications, which can be identified by the largest numeric version that does not contain a suffix. For example, if a client library has two packages: `v1` and `v2alpha`, then the latest stable version is `v1`. If you use an unstable release, breaking changes may be introduced when upgrading. You can read more about [Cloud API versioning strategy here](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/versioning).
