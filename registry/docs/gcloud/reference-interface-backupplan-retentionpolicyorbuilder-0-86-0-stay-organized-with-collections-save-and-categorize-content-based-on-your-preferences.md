## Implements

[MessageOrBuilder](https://cloud.google.com/java/docs/reference/protobuf/latest/com.google.protobuf.MessageOrBuilder.html)

## Methods

### getBackupDeleteLockDays()

```
public abstract int getBackupDeleteLockDays()
```

Optional. Minimum age for Backups created via this BackupPlan (in days). This field MUST be an integer value between 0-90 (inclusive). A Backup created under this BackupPlan will NOT be deletable until it reaches Backup's (create\_time + backup\_delete\_lock\_days). Updating this field of a BackupPlan does NOT affect existing Backups under it. Backups created AFTER a successful update will inherit the new value.

Default: 0 (no delete blocking)

`int32 backup_delete_lock_days = 1 [(.google.api.field_behavior) = OPTIONAL];`

**Returns**

**Type**

**Description**

`[int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)`

The backupDeleteLockDays.

### getBackupRetainDays()

```
public abstract int getBackupRetainDays()
```

Optional. The default maximum age of a Backup created via this BackupPlan. This field MUST be an integer value >= 0 and <= 365. If specified, a Backup created under this BackupPlan will be automatically deleted after its age reaches (create\_time + backup\_retain\_days). If not specified, Backups created under this BackupPlan will NOT be subject to automatic deletion. Updating this field does NOT affect existing Backups under it. Backups created AFTER a successful update will automatically pick up the new value. NOTE: backup\_retain\_days must be >= backup\_delete\_lock\_days. If cron\_schedule is defined, then this must be <= 360 \* the creation interval. If rpo\_config is defined, then this must be <= 360 \* target\_rpo\_minutes / (1440minutes/day).

Default: 0 (no automatic deletion)

`int32 backup_retain_days = 2 [(.google.api.field_behavior) = OPTIONAL];`

**Returns**

**Type**

**Description**

`[int](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)`

The backupRetainDays.

### getLocked()

```
public abstract boolean getLocked()
```

Optional. This flag denotes whether the retention policy of this BackupPlan is locked. If set to True, no further update is allowed on this policy, including the `locked` field itself.

Default: False

`bool locked = 3 [(.google.api.field_behavior) = OPTIONAL];`

**Returns**

**Type**

**Description**

`[boolean](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)`
